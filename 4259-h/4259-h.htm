      CLOTHING: ITS RAPID DETERIORATION, AND DEVICES TO REPLENISH IT&mdash;DESPERATE
      EFFORTS TO COVER NAKEDNESS&mdash;"LITTLE RED CAP" AND HIS LETTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothing had now become an object of real solicitude to us older
      prisoners. The veterans of our crowd&mdash;the surviving remnant of those
      captured at Gettysburg&mdash;had been prisoners over a year. The next in
      seniority&mdash;the Chickamauga boys&mdash;had been in ten months. The
      Mine Run fellows were eight months old, and my battalion had had seven
      months' incarceration. None of us were models of well-dressed gentlemen
      when captured. Our garments told the whole story of the hard campaigning
      we had undergone. Now, with months of the wear and tear of prison life,
      sleeping on the sand, working in tunnels, digging wells, etc., we were
      tattered and torn to an extent that a second-class tramp would have
      considered disgraceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is no reflection upon the quality of the clothes furnished by the
      Government. We simply reached the limit of the wear of textile fabrics. I
      am particular to say this, because I want to contribute my little mite
      towards doing justice to a badly abused part of our Army organization
      &mdash;the Quartermaster's Department. It is fashionable to speak of
      "shoddy," and utter some stereotyped sneers about "brown paper shoes," and
      "musketo-netting overcoats," when any discussion of the Quartermaster
      service is the subject of conversation, but I have no hesitation in asking
      the indorsement of my comrades to the statement that we have never found
      anywhere else as durable garments as those furnished us by the Government
      during our service in the Army. The clothes were not as fine in texture,
      nor so stylish in cut as those we wore before or since, but when it came
      to wear they could be relied on to the last thread. It was always
      marvelous to me that they lasted so well, with the rough usage a soldier
      in the field must necessarily give them. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a
      name="linkp287" id="linkp287"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p287.jpg (14K)" src="images/p287.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to my subject. I can best illustrate the way our clothes
      dropped off us, piece by piece, like the petals from the last rose of
      Summer, by taking my own case as an example: When I entered prison I was
      clad in the ordinary garb of an enlisted man of the cavalry&mdash;stout,
      comfortable boots, woolen pocks, drawers, pantaloons, with a
      "reenforcement," or "ready-made patches," as the infantry called them;
      vest, warm, snug-fitting jacket, under and over shirts, heavy overcoat,
      and a forage-cap. First my boots fell into cureless ruin, but this was no
      special hardship, as the weather had become quite warm, and it was more
      pleasant than otherwise to go barefooted. Then part of the underclothing
      retired from service. The jacket and vest followed, their end being
      hastened by having their best portions taken to patch up the pantaloons,
      which kept giving out at the most embarrassing places. Then the cape of
      the overcoat was called upon to assist in repairing these
      continually-recurring breaches in the nether garments. The same insatiate
      demand finally consumed the whole coat, in a vain attempt to prevent an
      exposure of person greater than consistent with the usages of society. The
      pantaloons&mdash;or what, by courtesy, I called such, were a monument of
      careful and ingenious, but hopeless, patching, that should have called
      forth the admiration of a Florentine artist in mosaic. I have been shown&mdash;in
      later years&mdash;many table tops, ornamented in marquetry, inlaid with
      thousands of little bits of wood, cunningly arranged, and patiently joined
      together. I always look at them with interest, for I know the work spent
      upon them: I remember my Andersonville pantaloons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clothing upon the upper part of my body had been reduced to the
      remains of a knit undershirt. It had fallen into so many holes that it
      looked like the coarse "riddles" through which ashes and gravel are
      sifted. Wherever these holes were the sun had burned my back, breast and
      shoulders deeply black. The parts covered by the threads and fragments
      forming the boundaries of the holes, were still white. When I pulled my
      alleged shirt off, to wash or to free it from some of its teeming
      population, my skin showed a fine lace pattern in black and white, that
      was very interesting to my comrades, and the subject of countless jokes by
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They used to descant loudly on the chaste elegance of the design, the
      richness of the tracing, etc., and beg me to furnish them with a copy of
      it when I got home, for their sisters to work window curtains or tidies
      by. They were sure that so striking a novelty in patterns would be very
      acceptable. I would reply to their witticisms in the language of Portia's
      Prince of Morocco:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mislike me not for my complexion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadowed livery of the burning sun. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      One of the stories told me in my childhood by an old negro nurse, was of a
      poverty stricken little girl "who slept on the floor and was covered with
      the door," and she once asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma how do poor folks get along who haven't any door?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same spirit I used to wonder how poor fellows got along who hadn't
      any shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      One common way of keeping up one's clothing was by stealing mealsacks. The
      meal furnished as rations was brought in in white cotton sacks. Sergeants
      of detachments were required to return these when the rations were issued
      the next day. I have before alluded to the general incapacity of the
      Rebels to deal accurately with even simple numbers. It was never very
      difficult for a shrewd Sergeant to make nine sacks count as ten. After
      awhile the Rebels began to see through this sleight of hand manipulation,
      and to check it. Then the Sergeants resorted to the device of tearing the
      sacks in two, and turning each half in as a whole one. The cotton cloth
      gained in this way was used for patching, or, if a boy could succeed in
      beating the Rebels out of enough of it, he would fabricate himself a shirt
      or a pair of pantaloons. We obtained all our thread in the same way. A
      half of a sack, carefully raveled out, would furnish a couple of handfuls
      of thread. Had it not been for this resource all our sewing and mending
      would have come to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our needles were manufactured by ourselves from bones. A piece of
      bone, split as near as possible to the required size, was carefully rubbed
      down upon a brick, and then had an eye laboriously worked through it with
      a bit of wire or something else available for the purpose. The needles
      were about the size of ordinary darning needles, and answered the purpose
      very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      These devices gave one some conception of the way savages provide for the
      wants of their lives. Time was with them, as with us, of little
      importance. It was no loss of time to them, nor to us, to spend a large
      portion of the waking hours of a week in fabricating a needle out of a
      bone, where a civilized man could purchase a much better one with the
      product of three minutes' labor. I do not think any red Indian of the
      plains exceeded us in the patience with which we worked away at these
      minutia of life's needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the most common source of clothing was the dead, and no body was
      carried out with any clothing on it that could be of service to the
      survivors. The Plymouth Pilgrims, who were so well clothed on coming in,
      and were now dying off very rapidly, furnished many good suits to cover
      the nakedness of older, prisoners. Most of the prisoners from the Army of
      the Potomac were well dressed, and as very many died within a month or six
      weeks after their entrance, they left their clothes in pretty good
      condition for those who constituted themselves their heirs, administrators
      and assigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I had the greatest aversion to wearing dead men's
      clothes, and could only bring myself to it after I had been a year in
      prison, and it became a question between doing that and freezing to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every new batch of prisoners was besieged with anxious inquiries on the
      subject which lay closest to all our hearts:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they doing about exchange!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in human experience&mdash;save the anxious expectancy of a sail by
      castaways on a desert island&mdash;could equal the intense eagerness with
      which this question was asked, and the answer awaited. To thousands now
      hanging on the verge of eternity it meant life or death. Between the first
      day of July and the first of November over twelve thousand men died, who
      would doubtless have lived had they been able to reach our lines&mdash;"get
      to God's country," as we expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new comers brought little reliable news of contemplated exchange.
      There was none to bring in the first place, and in the next, soldiers in
      active service in the field had other things to busy themselves with than
      reading up the details of the negotiations between the Commissioners of
      Exchange. They had all heard rumors, however, and by the time they reached
      Andersonville, they had crystallized these into actual statements of fact.
      A half hour after they entered the Stockade, a report like this would
      spread like wildfire:
    </p>
    <p>
      "An Army of the Potomac man has just come in, who was captured in front of
      Petersburg. He says that he read in the New York Herald, the day before he
      was taken, that an exchange had been agreed upon, and that our ships had
      already started for Savannah to take us home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then our hopes would soar up like balloons. We fed ourselves on such stuff
      from day to day, and doubtless many lives were greatly prolonged by the
      continual encouragement. There was hardly a day when I did not say to
      myself that I would much rather die than endure imprisonment another
      month, and had I believed that another month would see me still there, I
      am pretty certain that I should have ended the matter by crossing the Dead
      Line. I was firmly resolved not to die the disgusting, agonizing death
      that so many around me were dying. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp291"

      One of our best purveyors of information was a bright, blue-eyed,
      fair-haired little drummer boy, as handsome as a girl, well-bred as a
      lady, and evidently the darling of some refined loving mother. He
      belonged, I think, to some loyal Virginia regiment, was captured in one of
      the actions in the Shenandoa Valley, and had been with us in Richmond. We
      called him "Red Cap," from his wearing a jaunty, gold-laced, crimson cap.
      Ordinarily, the smaller a drummer boy is the harder he is, but no amount
      of attrition with rough men could coarse the ingrained refinement of Red
      Cap's manners. He was between thirteen and fourteen, and it seemed utterly
      shameful that men, calling themselves soldier should make war on such a
      tender boy and drag him off to prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no six-footer had a more soldierly heart than little Red Cap, and none
      were more loyal to the cause. It was a pleasure to hear him tell the story
      of the fights and movements his regiment had been engaged in. He was a
      good observer and told his tale with boyish fervor. Shortly after Wirz
      assumed command he took Red Cap into his office as an Orderly. His bright
      face and winning manner; fascinated the women visitors at headquarters,
      and numbers of them tried to adopt him, but with poor success. Like the
      rest of us, he could see few charms in an existence under the Rebel flag,
      and turned a deaf ear to their blandishments. He kept his ears open to the
      conversation of the Rebel officers around him, and frequently secured
      permission to visit the interior of the Stockade, when he would
      communicate to us all that he has heard. He received a flattering
      reception every time he cams in, and no orator ever secured a more
      attentive audience than would gather around him to listen to what he had
      to say. He was, beyond a doubt, the best known and most popular person in
      the prison, and I know all the survivors of his old admirer; share my
      great interest in him, and my curiosity as to whether he yet lives, and
      whether his subsequent career has justified the sanguine hopes we all had
      as to his future. I hope that if he sees this, or any one who knows
      anything about him, he will communicate with me. There are thousands who
      will be glad to hear from him.

      A most remarkable coincidence occurred in regard to this comrade. Several
      days after the above had been written, and "set up," but before it had yet
      appeared in the paper, I received the following letter:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To the Editor of the BLADE:
    </p>
    <p>
      Last evening I saw a copy of your paper, in which was a chapter or two of
      a prison life of a soldier during the late war. I was forcibly struck with
      the correctness of what he wrote, and the names of several of my old
      comrades which he quoted: Hill, Limber Jim, etc., etc. I was a drummer boy
      of Company I, Tenth West Virginia Infantry, and was fifteen years of age a
      day or two after arriving in Andersonville, which was in the last of
      February, 1884. Nineteen of my comrades were there with me, and, poor
      fellows, they are there yet. I have no doubt that I would have remained
      there, too, had I not been more fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know who your soldier correspondent is, but assume to say that
      from the following description he will remember having seen me in
      Andersonville: I was the little boy that for three or four months
      officiated as orderly for Captain Wirz. I wore a red cap, and every day
      could be seen riding Wirz's gray mare, either at headquarters, or about
      the Stockade. I was acting in this capacity when the six raiders &mdash;"Mosby,"
      (proper name Collins) Delaney, Curtis, and&mdash;I forget the other names&mdash;were
      executed. I believe that I was the first that conveyed the intelligence to
      them that Confederate General Winder had approved their sentence. As soon
      as Wirz received the dispatch to that effect, I ran down to the stocks and
      told them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I visited Hill, of Wauseon, Fulton County, O., since the war, and found
      him hale and hearty. I have not heard from him for a number of years until
      reading your correspondent's letter last evening. It is the only letter of
      the series that I have seen, but after reading that one, I feel called
      upon to certify that I have no doubts of the truthfulness of your
      correspondent's story. The world will never know or believe the horrors of
      Andersonville and other prisons in the South. No living, human being, in
      my judgment, will ever be able to properly paint the horrors of those
      infernal dens.
    </p>
    <p>
      I formed the acquaintance of several Ohio soldiers whilst in prison. Among
      these were O. D. Streeter, of Cleveland, who went to Andersonville about
      the same time that I did, and escaped, and was the only man that I ever
      knew that escaped and reached our lines. After an absence of several
      months he was retaken in one of Sherman's battles before Atlanta, and
      brought back. I also knew John L. Richards, of Fostoria, Seneca County, O.
      or Eaglesville, Wood County. Also, a man by the name of Beverly, who was a
      partner of Charley Aucklebv, of Tennessee. I would like to hear from all
      of these parties. They all know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Editor, I will close by wishing all my comrades who shared in the
      sufferings and dangers of Confederate prisons, a long and useful life.

    <h3>
      SOME FEATURES OF THE MORTALITY&mdash;PERCENTAGE OF DEATHS TO THOSE LIVING
      &mdash;AN AVERAGE MEAN ONLY STANDS THE MISERY THREE MONTHS&mdash;DESCRIPTION
      OF THE PRISON AND THE CONDITION OF THE MEN THEREIN, BY A LEADING
      SCIENTIFIC MAN OF THE SOUTH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Speaking of the manner in which the Plymouth Pilgrims were now dying, I am
      reminded of my theory that the ordinary man's endurance of this prison
      life did not average over three months. The Plymouth boys arrived in May;
      the bulk of those who died passed away in July and August. The great
      increase of prisoners from all sources was in May, June and July. The
      greatest mortality among these was in August, September and October.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many came in who had been in good health during their service in the
      field, but who seemed utterly overwhelmed by the appalling misery they saw
      on every hand, and giving way to despondency, died in a few days or weeks.
      I do not mean to include them in the above class, as their sickness was
      more mental than physical. My idea is that, taking one hundred ordinarily
      healthful young soldiers from a regiment in active service, and putting
      them into Andersonville, by the end of the third month at least
      thirty-three of those weakest and most vulnerable to disease would have
      succumbed to the exposure, the pollution of ground and air, and the
      insufficiency of the ration of coarse corn meal. After this the mortality
      would be somewhat less, say at the end of six months fifty of them would
      be dead. The remainder would hang on still more tenaciously, and at the
      end of a year there would be fifteen or twenty still alive. There were
      sixty-three of my company taken; thirteen lived through. I believe this
      was about the usual proportion for those who were in as long as we. In all
      there were forty-five thousand six hundred and thirteen prisoners brought
      into Andersonville. Of these twelve thousand nine hundred and twelve died
      there, to say nothing of thousands that died in other prisons in Georgia
      and the Carolinas, immediately after their removal from Andersonville. One
      of every three and a-half men upon whom the gates of the Stockade closed
      never repassed them alive. Twenty-nine per cent. of the boys who so much
      as set foot in Andersonville died there. Let it be kept in mind all the
      time, that the average stay of a prisoner there was not four months. The
      great majority came in after the 1st of May, and left before the middle of
      September. May 1, 1864, there were ten thousand four hundred and
      twenty-seven in the Stockade. August 8 there were thirty-three thousand
      one hundred and fourteen; September 30 all these were dead or gone, except
      eight thousand two hundred and eighteen, of whom four thousand five
      hundred and ninety died inside of the next thirty days. The records of the
      world can shove no parallel to this astounding mortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the above matter was first published in the BLADE, a friend has sent
      me a transcript of the evidence at the Wirz trial, of Professor Joseph
      Jones, a Surgeon of high rank in the Rebel Army, and who stood at the head
      of the medical profession in Georgia. He visited Andersonville at the
      instance of the Surgeon-General of the Confederate States' Army, to make a
      study, for the benefit of science, of the phenomena of disease occurring
      there. His capacity and opportunities for observation, and for clearly
      estimating the value of the facts coming under his notice were, of course,
      vastly superior to mine, and as he states the case stronger than I dare
      to, for fear of being accused of exaggeration and downright untruth, I
      reproduce the major part of his testimony&mdash;embodying also his
      official report to medical headquarters at Richmond&mdash;that my readers
      may know how the prison appeared to the eyes of one who, though a bitter
      Rebel, was still a humane man and a conscientious observer, striving to
      learn the truth: <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp295" id="linkp295"></a>

    </p>
    <p>
      Q. How were you employed during the Rebellion?
    </p>
    <p>
      A. I served six months in the early part of it as a private in the ranks,
      and the rest of the time in the medical department.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q. Under the direction of whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Under the direction of Dr. Moore, Surgeon General.

    </p>
    <p>
      Q. Is it accurate?
    </p>
    <p>
      A. So far as my examination extended, it is accurate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The document just examined by witness was offered in evidence, and is as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Observations upon the diseases of the Federal prisoners, confined to Camp
      Sumter, Andersonville, in Sumter County, Georgia, instituted with a view
      to illustrate chiefly the origin and causes of hospital gangrene, the
      relations of continued and malarial fevers, and the pathology of camp
      diarrhea and dysentery, by Joseph Jones; Surgeon P. A. C. S., Professor of
      Medical Chemistry in the Medical College of Georgia, at Augusta, Georgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing of the unusual mortality among the Federal prisoners confined at
      Andersonville; Georgia, in the month of August, 1864, during a visit to
      Richmond, Va., I expressed to the Surgeon General, S. P. Moore,
      Confederate States of America, a desire to visit Camp Sumter, with the
      design of instituting a series of inquiries upon the nature and causes of
      the prevailing diseases. Smallpox had appeared among the prisoners, and I
      believed that this would prove an admirable field for the establishment of
      its characteristic lesions. The condition of Peyer's glands in this
      disease was considered as worthy of minute investigation. It was believed
      that a large body of men from the Northern portion of the United States,
      suddenly transported to a warm Southern climate, and confined upon a small
      portion of land, would furnish an excellent field for the investigation of
      the relations of typhus, typhoid, and malarial fevers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Surgeon General of the Confederate States of America furnished me with
      the following letter of introduction to the Surgeon in charge of the
      Confederate States Military Prison at Andersonville, Ga.: <br /><br /><br />

      SIR:&mdash;The field of pathological investigations afforded by the large
      collection of Federal prisoners in Georgia, is of great extant and
      importance, and it is believed that results of value to the profession may
      be obtained by careful investigation of the effects of disease upon the
      large body of men subjected to a decided change of climate and those
      circumstances peculiar to prison life. The Surgeon in charge of the
      hospital for Federal prisoners, together with his assistants, will afford
      every facility to Surgeon Joseph Jones, in the prosecution of the labors
      ordered by the Surgeon General. Efficient assistance must be rendered
      Surgeon Jones by the medical officers, not only in his examinations into
      the causes and symptoms of the various diseases, but especially in the
      arduous labors of post mortem examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical officers will assist in the performance of such post-mortems
      as Surgeon Jones may indicate, in order that this great field for
      pathological investigation may be explored for the benefit of the Medical
      Department of the Confederate Army.

    <p>
      The Confederate Military Prison at Andersonville, Ga., consists of a
      strong Stockade, twenty feet in height, enclosing twenty-seven acres. The
      Stockade is formed of strong pine logs, firmly planted in the ground. The
      main Stockade is surrounded by two other similar rows of pine logs, the
      middle Stockade being sixteen feet high, and the outer twelve feet. These
      are intended for offense and defense. If the inner Stockade should at any
      time be forced by the prisoners, the second forms another line of defense;
      while in case of an attempt to deliver the prisoners by a force operating
      upon the exterior, the outer line forms an admirable protection to the
      Confederate troops, and a most formidable obstacle to cavalry or infantry.
      The four angles of the outer line are strengthened by earthworks upon
      commanding eminences, from which the cannon, in case of an outbreak among
      the prisoners, may sweep the entire enclosure; and it was designed to
      connect these works by a line of rifle pits, running zig-zag, around the
      outer Stockade; those rifle pits have never been completed. The ground
      enclosed by the innermost Stockade lies in the form of a parallelogram,
      the larger diameter running almost due north and south. This space
      includes the northern and southern opposing sides of two hills, between
      which a stream of water runs from west to east. The surface soil of these
      hills is composed chiefly of sand with varying admixtures of clay and
      oxide of iron. The clay is sufficiently tenacious to give a considerable
      degree of consistency to the soil. The internal structure of the hills, as
      revealed by the deep wells, is similar to that already described. The
      alternate layers of clay and sand, as well as the oxide of iron, which
      forms in its various combinations a cement to the sand, allow of extensive
      tunneling. The prisoners not only constructed numerous dirt huts with
      balls of clay and sand, taken from the wells which they have excavated all
      over those hills, but they have also, in some cases, tunneled extensively
      from these wells. The lower portions of these hills, bordering on the
      stream, are wet and boggy from the constant oozing of water. The Stockade
      was built originally to accommodate only ten thousand prisoners, and
      included at first seventeen acres. Near the close of the month of June the
      area was enlarged by the addition of ten acres. The ground added was
      situated on the northern slope of the largest hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average number of square feet of ground to each prisoner in August
      1864: 35.7
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the circumscribed area of the Stockade the Federal prisoners were
      compelled to perform all the offices of life&mdash;cooking, washing, the
      calls of nature, exercise, and sleeping. During the month of March the
      prison was less crowded than at any subsequent time, and then the average
      space of ground to each prisoner was only 98.7 feet, or less than seven
      square yards. The Federal prisoners were gathered from all parts of the
      Confederate States east of the Mississippi, and crowded into the confined
      space, until in the month of June the average number of square feet of
      ground to each prisoner was only 33.2 or less than four square yards.
      These figures represent the condition of the Stockade in a better light
      even than it really was; for a considerable breadth of land along the
      stream, flowing from west to east between the hills, was low and boggy,
      and was covered with the excrement of the men, and thus rendered wholly
      uninhabitable, and in fact useless for every purpose except that of
      defecation. The pines and other small trees and shrubs, which originally
      were scattered sparsely over these hills, were in a short time cut down
      and consumed by the prisoners for firewood, and no shade tree was left in
      the entire enclosure of the stockade. With their characteristic industry
      and ingenuity, the Federals constructed for themselves small huts and
      caves, and attempted to shield themselves from the rain and sun and night
      damps and dew. But few tents were distributed to the prisoners, and those
      were in most cases torn and rotten. In the location and arrangement of
      these tents and huts no order appears to have been followed; in fact,
      regular streets appear to be out of the question in so crowded an area;
      especially too, as large bodies of prisoners were from time to time added
      suddenly without any previous preparations. The irregular arrangement of
      the huts and imperfect shelters was very unfavorable for the maintenance
      of a proper system of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police and internal economy of the prison was left almost entirely in
      the hands of the prisoners themselves; the duties of the Confederate
      soldiers acting as guards being limited to the occupation of the boxes or
      lookouts ranged around the stockade at regular intervals, and to the
      manning of the batteries at the angles of the prison. Even judicial
      matters pertaining to themselves, as the detection and punishment of such
      crimes as theft and murder appear to have been in a great measure
      abandoned to the prisoners. A striking instance of this occurred in the
      month of July, when the Federal prisoners within the Stockade tried,
      condemned, and hanged six (6) of their own number, who had been convicted
      of stealing and of robbing and murdering their fellow-prisoners. They were
      all hung upon the same day, and thousands of the prisoners gathered around
      to witness the execution. The Confederate authorities are said not to have
      interfered with these proceedings. In this collection of men from all
      parts of the world, every phase of human character was represented; the
      stronger preyed upon the weaker, and even the sick who were unable to
      defend themselves were robbed of their scanty supplies of food and
      clothing. Dark stories were afloat, of men, both sick and well, who were
      murdered at night, strangled to death by their comrades for scant supplies
      of clothing or money. I heard a sick and wounded Federal prisoner accuse
      his nurse, a fellow-prisoner of the United States Army, of having
      stealthily, during his sleep inoculated his wounded arm with gangrene,
      that he might destroy his life and fall heir to his clothing. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      ....................................
    </p>
    <p>
      The large number of men confined within the Stockade soon, under a
      defective system of police, and with imperfect arrangements, covered the
      surface of the low grounds with excrements. The sinks over the lower
      portions of the stream were imperfect in their plan and structure, and the
      excrements were in large measure deposited so near the borders of the
      stream as not to be washed away, or else accumulated upon the low boggy
      ground. The volume of water was not sufficient to wash away the feces, and
      they accumulated in such quantities in the lower portion of the stream as
      to form a mass of liquid excrement heavy rains caused the water of the
      stream to rise, and as the arrangements for the passage of the increased
      amounts of water out of the Stockade were insufficient, the liquid feces
      overflowed the low grounds and covered them several inches, after the
      subsidence of the waters. The action of the sun upon this putrefying mass
      of excrements and fragments of bread and meat and bones excited most rapid
      fermentation and developed a horrible stench. Improvements were projected
      for the removal of the filth and for the prevention of its accumulation,
      but they were only partially and imperfectly carried out. As the forces of
      the prisoners were reduced by confinement, want of exercise, improper
      diet, and by scurvy, diarrhea, and dysentery, they were unable to evacuate
      their bowels within the stream or along its banks, and the excrements were
      deposited at the very doors of their tents. The vast majority appeared to
      lose all repulsion to filth, and both sick and well disregarded all the
      laws of hygiene and personal cleanliness. The accommodations for the sick
      were imperfect and insufficient. From the organization of the prison,
      February 24, 1864, to May 22, the sick were treated within the Stockade.
      In the crowded condition of the Stockade, and with the tents and huts
      clustered thickly around the hospital, it was impossible to secure proper
      ventilation or to maintain the necessary police. The Federal prisoners
      also made frequent forays upon the hospital stores and carried off the
      food and clothing of the sick. The hospital was, on the 22d of May,
      removed to its present site without the Stockade, and five acres of ground
      covered with oaks and pines appropriated to the use of the sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supply of medical officers has been insufficient from the foundation
      of the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurses and attendants upon the sick have been most generally Federal
      prisoners, who in too many cases appear to have been devoid of moral
      principle, and who not only neglected their duties, but were also engaged
      in extensive robbing of the sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the want of proper police and hygienic regulations alone it is not
      wonderful that from February 24 to September 21, 1864, nine thousand four
      hundred and seventy-nine deaths, nearly one-third the entire number of
      prisoners, should have been recorded. I found the Stockade and hospital in
      the following condition during my pathological investigations, instituted
      in the month of September, 1864: <br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      STOCKADE, CONFEDERATE STATES MILITARY PRISON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the time of my visit to Andersonville a large number of Federal
      prisoners had been removed to Millen, Savannah; Charleston, and other
      parts of, the Confederacy, in anticipation of an advance of General
      Sherman's forces from Atlanta, with the design of liberating their captive
      brethren; however, about fifteen thousand prisoners remained confined
      within the limits of the Stockade and Confederate States Military Prison
      Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Stockade, with the exception of the damp lowlands bordering the
      small stream, the surface was covered with huts, and small ragged tents
      and parts of blankets and fragments of oil-cloth, coats, and blankets
      stretched upon stacks. The tents and huts were not arranged according to
      any order, and there was in most parts of the enclosure scarcely room for
      two men to walk abreast between the tents and huts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one might judge from the large pieces of corn-bread scattered about in
      every direction on the ground the prisoners were either very lavishly
      supplied with this article of diet, or else this kind of food was not
      relished by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day the dead from the Stockade were carried out by their
      fellow-prisoners and deposited upon the ground under a bush arbor, just
      outside of the Southwestern Gate. From thence they were carried in carts
      to the burying ground, one-quarter of a mile northwest, of the Prison. The
      dead were buried without coffins, side by side, in trenches four feet
      deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low grounds bordering the stream were covered with human excrements
      and filth of all kinds, which in many places appeared to be alive with
      working maggots. An indescribable sickening stench arose from these
      fermenting masses of human filth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were near five thousand seriously ill Federals in the Stockade and
      Confederate States Military Prison Hospital, and the deaths exceeded one
      hundred per day, and large numbers of the prisoners who were walking
      about, and who had not been entered upon the sick reports, were suffering
      from severe and incurable diarrhea, dysentery, and scurvy. The sick were
      attended almost entirely by their fellow-prisoners, appointed as nurses,
      and as they received but little attention, they were compelled to exert
      themselves at all times to attend to the calls of nature, and hence they
      retained the power of moving about to within a comparatively short period
      of the close of life. Owing to the slow progress of the diseases most
      prevalent, diarrhea, and chronic dysentery, the corpses were as a general
      rule emaciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I visited two thousand sick within the Stockade, lying under some long
      sheds which had been built at the northern portion for themselves. At this
      time only one medical officer was in attendance, whereas at least twenty
      medical officers should have been employed.

      Scurvy, diarrhea, dysentery, and hospital gangrene were the prevailing
      diseases. I was surprised to find but few cases of malarial fever, and no
      well-marked cases either of typhus or typhoid fever. The absence of the
      different forms of malarial fever may be accounted for in the supposition
      that the artificial atmosphere of the Stockade, crowded densely with human
      beings and loaded with animal exhalations, was unfavorable to the
      existence and action of the malarial poison. The absence of typhoid and
      typhus fevers amongst all the causes which are supposed to generate these
      diseases, appeared to be due to the fact that the great majority of these
      prisoners had been in captivity in Virginia, at Belle Island, and in other
      parts of the Confederacy for months, and even as long as two years, and
      during this time they had been subjected to the same bad influences, and
      those who had not had these fevers before either had them during their
      confinement in Confederate prisons or else their systems, from long
      exposure, were proof against their action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of scurvy were manifested on every hand, and in all its
      various stages, from the muddy, pale complexion, pale gums, feeble,
      languid muscular motions, lowness of spirits, and fetid breath, to the
      dusky, dirty, leaden complexion, swollen features, spongy, purple, livid,
      fungoid, bleeding gums, loose teeth, oedematous limbs, covered with livid
      vibices, and petechiae spasmodically flexed, painful and hardened
      extremities, spontaneous hemorrhages from mucous canals, and large,
      ill-conditioned, spreading ulcers covered with a dark purplish fungus
      growth. I observed that in some of the cases of scurvy the parotid glands
      were greatly swollen, and in some instances to such an extent as to
      preclude entirely the power to articulate. In several cases of dropsy of
      the abdomen and lower extremities supervening upon scurvy, the patients
      affirmed that previously to the appearance of the dropsy they had suffered
      with profuse and obstinate diarrhea, and that when this was checked by a
      change of diet, from Indian corn-bread baked with the husk, to boiled
      rice, the dropsy appeared. The severe pains and livid patches were
      frequently associated with swellings in various parts, and especially in
      the lower extremities, accompanied with stiffness and contractions of the
      knee joints and ankles, and often with a brawny feel of the parts, as if
      lymph had been effused between the integuments and apeneuroses, preventing
      the motion of the skin over the swollen parts. Many of the prisoners
      believed that the scurvy was contagious, and I saw men guarding their
      wells and springs, fearing lest some man suffering with the scurvy might
      use the water and thus poison them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed also numerous cases of hospital gangrene, and of spreading
      scorbutic ulcers, which had supervened upon slight injuries. The scorbutic
      ulcers presented a dark, purple fungoid, elevated surface, with livid
      swollen edges, and exuded a thin; fetid, sanious fluid, instead of pus.
      Many ulcers which originated from the scorbutic condition of the system
      appeared to become truly gangrenous, assuming all the characteristics of
      hospital gangrene. From the crowded condition, filthy habits, bad diet,
      and dejected, depressed condition of the prisoners, their systems had
      become so disordered that the smallest abrasion of the skin, from the
      rubbing of a shoe, or from the effects of the sun, or from the prick of a
      splinter, or from scratching, or a musketo bite, in some cases, took on
      rapid and frightful ulceration and gangrene. The long use of salt meat,
      ofttimes imperfectly cured, as well as the most total deprivation of
      vegetables and fruit, appeared to be the chief causes of the scurvy. I
      carefully examined the bakery and the bread furnished the prisoners, and
      found that they were supplied almost entirely with corn-bread from which
      the husk had not been separated. This husk acted as an irritant to the
      alimentary canal, without adding any nutriment to the bread. As far as my
      examination extended no fault could be found with the mode in which the
      bread was baked; the difficulty lay in the failure to separate the husk
      from the corn-meal. I strongly urged the preparation of large quantities
      of soup made from the cow and calves' heads with the brains and tongues,
      to which a liberal supply of sweet potatos and vegetables might have been
      advantageously added. The material existed in abundance for the
      preparation of such soup in large quantities with but little additional
      expense. Such aliment would have been not only highly nutritious, but it
      would also have acted as an efficient remedial agent for the removal of
      the scorbutic condition. The sick within the Stockade lay under several
      long sheds which were originally built for barracks. These sheds covered
      two floors which were open on all sides. The sick lay upon the bare
      boards, or upon such ragged blankets as they possessed, without, as far as
      I observed, any bedding or even straw. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      ............................
    </p>
    <p>
      The haggard, distressed countenances of these miserable, complaining,
      dejected, living skeletons, crying for medical aid and food, and cursing
      their Government for its refusal to exchange prisoners, and the ghastly
      corpses, with their glazed eye balls staring up into vacant space, with
      the flies swarming down their open and grinning mouths, and over their
      ragged clothes, infested with numerous lice, as they lay amongst the sick
      and dying, formed a picture of helpless, hopeless misery which it would be
      impossible to portray bywords or by the brush. A feeling of disappointment
      and even resentment on account of the United States Government upon the
      subject of the exchange of prisoners, appeared to be widespread, and the
      apparent hopeless nature of the negotiations for some general exchange of
      prisoners appeared to be a cause of universal regret and deep and
      injurious despondency. I heard some of the prisoners go so far as to
      exonerate the Confederate Government from any charge of intentionally
      subjecting them to a protracted confinement, with its necessary and
      unavoidable sufferings, in a country cut off from all intercourse with
      foreign nations, and sorely pressed on all sides, whilst on the other hand
      they charged their prolonged captivity upon their own Government, which
      was attempting to make the negro equal to the white man. Some hundred or
      more of the prisoners had been released from confinement in the Stockade
      on parole, and filled various offices as clerks, druggists, and
      carpenters, etc., in the various departments. These men were well clothed,
      and presented a stout and healthy appearance, and as a general rule they
      presented a much more robust and healthy appearance than the Confederate
      troops guarding the prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire grounds are surrounded by a frail board fence, and are strictly
      guarded by Confederate soldiers, and no prisoner except the paroled
      attendants is allowed to leave the grounds except by a special permit from
      the Commandant of the Interior of the Prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patients and attendants, near two thousand in number, are crowded into
      this confined space and are but poorly supplied with old and ragged tents.
      Large numbers of them were without any bunks in the tents, and lay upon
      the ground, oft-times without even a blanket. No beds or straw appeared to
      have been furnished. The tents extend to within a few yards of the small
      stream, the eastern portion of which, as we have before said, is used as a
      privy and is loaded with excrements; and I observed a large pile of
      corn-bread, bones, and filth of all kinds, thirty feet in diameter and
      several feet in hight, swarming with myriads of flies, in a vacant space
      near the pots used for cooking. Millions of flies swarmed over everything,
      and covered the faces of the sleeping patients, and crawled down their
      open mouths, and deposited their maggots in the gangrenous wounds of the
      living, and in the mouths of the dead. Musketos in great numbers also
      infested the tents, and many of the patients were so stung by these
      pestiferous insects, that they resembled those suffering from a slight
      attack of the measles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police and hygiene of the hospital were defective in the extreme; the
      attendants, who appeared in almost every instance to have been selected
      from the prisoners, seemed to have in many cases but little interest in
      the welfare of their fellow-captives. The accusation was made that the
      nurses in many cases robbed the sick of their clothing, money, and
      rations, and carried on a clandestine trade with the paroled prisoners and
      Confederate guards without the hospital enclosure, in the clothing,
      effects of the sick, dying, and dead Federals. They certainly appeared to
      neglect the comfort and cleanliness of the sick intrusted to their care in
      a most shameful manner, even after making due allowances for the
      difficulties of the situation. Many of the sick were literally encrusted
      with dirt and filth and covered with vermin. When a gangrenous wound
      needed washing, the limb was thrust out a little from the blanket, or
      board, or rags upon which the patient was lying, and water poured over it,
      and all the putrescent matter allowed to soak into the ground floor of the
      tent. The supply of rags for dressing wounds was said to be very scant,
      and I saw the most filthy rags which had been applied several times, and
      imperfectly washed, used in dressing wounds. Where hospital gangrene was
      prevailing, it was impossible for any wound to escape contagion under
      these circumstances. The results of the treatment of wounds in the
      hospital were of the most unsatisfactory character, from this neglect of
      cleanliness, in the dressings and wounds themselves, as well as from
      various other causes which will be more fully considered. I saw several
      gangrenous wounds filled with maggots. I have frequently seen neglected
      wounds amongst the Confederate soldiers similarly affected; and as far as
      my experience extends, these worms destroy only the dead tissues and do
      not injure specially the well parts. I have even heard surgeons affirm
      that a gangrenous wound which had been thoroughly cleansed by maggots,
      healed more rapidly than if it had been left to itself. This want of
      cleanliness on the part of the nurses appeared to be the result of
      carelessness and inattention, rather than of malignant design, and the
      whole trouble can be traced to the want of the proper police and sanitary
      regulations, and to the absence of intelligent organization and division
      of labor. The abuses were in a large measure due to the almost total
      absence of system, government, and rigid, but wholesome sanitary
      regulations. In extenuation of these abuses it was alleged by the medical
      officers that the Confederate troops were barely sufficient to guard the
      prisoners, and that it was impossible to obtain any number of experienced
      nurses from the Confederate forces. In fact the guard appeared to be too
      small, even for the regulation of the internal hygiene and police of the
      hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner of disposing of the dead was also calculated to depress the
      already desponding spirits of these men, many of whom have been confined
      for months, and even for nearly two years in Richmond and other places,
      and whose strength had been wasted by bad air, bad food, and neglect of
      personal cleanliness. The dead-house is merely a frame covered with old
      tent cloth and a few bushes, situated in the southwestern corner of the
      hospital grounds. When a patient dies, he is simply laid in the narrow
      street in front of his tent, until he is removed by Federal negros
      detailed to carry off the dead; if a patient dies during the night, he
      lies there until the morning, and during the day even the dead were
      frequently allowed to remain for hours in these walks. In the dead-house
      the corpses lie upon the bare ground, and were in most cases covered with
      filth and vermin. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp312" id="linkp312"></a>

      The cooking arrangements are of the most defective character. Five large
      iron pots similar to those used for boiling sugar cane, appeared to be the
      only cooking utensils furnished by the hospital for the cooking of nearly
      two thousand men; and the patients were dependent in great measure upon
      their own miserable utensils. They were allowed to cook in the tent doors
      and in the lanes, and this was another source of filth, and another
      favorable condition for the generation and multiplication of flies and
      other vermin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air of the tents was foul and disagreeable in the extreme, and in fact
      the entire grounds emitted a most nauseous and disgusting smell. I entered
      nearly all the tents and carefully examined the cases of interest, and
      especially the cases of gangrene, upon numerous occasions, during the
      prosecution of my pathological inquiries at Andersonville, and therefore
      enjoyed every opportunity to judge correctly of the hygiene and police of
      the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      There appeared to be almost absolute indifference and neglect on the part
      of the patients of personal cleanliness; their persons and clothing inmost
      instances, and especially of those suffering with gangrene and scorbutic
      ulcers, were filthy in the extreme and covered with vermin. It was too
      often the case that patients were received from the Stockade in a most
      deplorable condition. I have seen men brought in from the Stockade in a
      dying condition, begrimed from head to foot with their own excrements, and
      so black from smoke and filth that they, resembled negros rather than
      white men. That this description of the Stockade and hospital has not been
      overdrawn, will appear from the reports of the surgeons in charge,
      appended to this report.
    </p>
    <p>
      .........................
    </p>
    <p>
      We will examine first the consolidated report of the sick and wounded
      Federal prisoners. During six months, from the 1st of March to the 31st of
      August, forty-two thousand six hundred and eighty-six cases of diseases
      and wounds were reported. No classified record of the sick in the Stockade
      was kept after the establishment of the hospital without the Prison. This
      fact, in conjunction with those already presented relating to the
      insufficiency of medical officers and the extreme illness and even death
      of many prisoners in the tents in the Stockade, without any medical
      attention or record beyond the bare number of the dead, demonstrate that
      these figures, large as they, appear to be, are far below the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the number of prisoners varied greatly at different periods, the
      relations between those reported sick and well, as far as those statistics
      extend, can best be determined by a comparison of the statistics of each
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period of six months no less than five hundred and sixty-five
      deaths are recorded under the head of 'morbi vanie.' In other words, those
      men died without having received sufficient medical attention for the
      determination of even the name of the disease causing death.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of August fifty-three cases and fifty-three deaths are
      recorded as due to marasmus. Surely this large number of deaths must have
      been due to some other morbid state than slow wasting. If they were due to
      improper and insufficient food, they should have been classed accordingly,
      and if to diarrhea or dysentery or scurvy, the classification should in
      like manner have been explicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We observe a progressive increase of the rate of mortality, from 3.11 per
      cent. in March to 9.09 per cent. of mean strength, sick and well, in
      August. The ratio of mortality continued to increase during September, for
      notwithstanding the removal of one-half of the entire number of prisoners
      during the early portion of the month, one thousand seven hundred and
      sixty-seven (1,767) deaths are registered from September 1 to 21, and the
      largest number of deaths upon any one day occurred during this month, on
      the 16th, viz. one hundred and nineteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire number of Federal prisoners confined at Andersonville was about
      forty thousand six hundred and eleven; and during the period of near seven
      months, from February 24 to September 21, nine thousand four hundred and
      seventy-nine (9,479) deaths were recorded; that is, during this period
      near one-fourth, or more, exactly one in 4.2, or 13.3 per cent.,
      terminated fatally. This increase of mortality was due in great measure to
      the accumulation of the sources of disease, as the increase of excrements
      and filth of all kinds, and the concentration of noxious effluvia, and
      also to the progressive effects of salt diet, crowding, and the hot
      climate. <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      CONCLUSIONS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      1st. The great mortality among the Federal prisoners confined in the
      military prison at Andersonville was not referable to climatic causes, or
      to the nature of the soil and waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      2d. The chief causes of death were scurvy and its results and bowel
      affections-chronic and acute diarrhea and dysentery. The bowel affections
      appear to have been due to the diet, the habits of the patients, the
      depressed, dejected state of the nervous system and moral and intellectual
      powers, and to the effluvia arising from the decomposing animal and
      vegetable filth. The effects of salt meat, and an unvarying diet of
      cornmeal, with but few vegetables, and imperfect supplies of vinegar and
      syrup, were manifested in the great prevalence of scurvy. This disease,
      without doubt, was also influenced to an important extent in its origin
      and course by the foul animal emanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      3d. From the sameness of the food and form, the action of the poisonous
      gases in the densely crowded and filthy Stockade and hospital, the blood
      was altered in its constitution, even before the manifestation of actual
      disease. In both the well and the sick the red corpuscles were diminished;
      and in all diseases uncomplicated with inflammation, the fibrous element
      was deficient. In cases of ulceration of the mucous membrane of the
      intestinal canal, the fibrous element of the blood was increased; while in
      simple diarrhea, uncomplicated with ulceration, it was either diminished
      or else remained stationary. Heart clots were very common, if not
      universally present, in cases of ulceration of the intestinal mucous
      membrane, while in the uncomplicated cases of diarrhea and scurvy, the
      blood was fluid and did not coagulate readily, and the heart clots and
      fibrous concretions were almost universally absent. From the watery
      condition of the blood, there resulted various serous effusions into the
      pericardium, ventricles of the brain, and into the abdomen. In almost all
      the cases which I examined after death, even the most emaciated, there was
      more or less serous effusion into the abdominal cavity. In cases of
      hospital gangrene of the extremities, and in cases of gangrene of the
      intestines, heart clots and fibrous coagula were universally present. The
      presence of those clots in the cases of hospital gangrene, while they were
      absent in the cases in which there was no inflammatory symptoms, sustains
      the conclusion that hospital gangrene is a species of inflammation,
      imperfect and irregular though it may be in its progress, in which the
      fibrous element and coagulation of the blood are increased, even in those
      who are suffering from such a condition of the blood, and from such
      diseases as are naturally accompanied with a decrease in the fibrous
      constituent.
    </p>
    <p>
      4th. The fact that hospital Gangrene appeared in the Stockade first, and
      originated spontaneously without any previous contagion, and occurred
      sporadically all over the Stockade and prison hospital, was proof positive
      that this disease will arise whenever the conditions of crowding, filth,
      foul air, and bad diet are present. The exhalations from the hospital and
      Stockade appeared to exert their effects to a considerable distance
      outside of these localities. The origin of hospital gangrene among these
      prisoners appeared clearly to depend in great measure upon the state of
      the general system induced by diet, and various external noxious
      influences. The rapidity of the appearance and action of the gangrene
      depended upon the powers and state of the constitution, as well as upon
      the intensity of the poison in the atmosphere, or upon the direct
      application of poisonous matter to the wounded surface. This was further
      illustrated by the important fact that hospital gangrene, or a disease
      resembling it in all essential respects, attacked the intestinal canal of
      patients laboring under ulceration of the bowels, although there were no
      local manifestations of gangrene upon the surface of the body. This mode
      of termination in cases of dysentery was quite common in the foul
      atmosphere of the Confederate States Military Hospital, in the depressed,
      depraved condition of the system of these Federal prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      5th. A scorbutic condition of the system appeared to favor the origin of
      foul ulcers, which frequently took on true hospital gangrene. Scurvy and
      hospital gangrene frequently existed in the same individual. In such
      cases, vegetable diet, with vegetable acids, would remove the scorbutic
      condition without curing the hospital gangrene. From the results of the
      existing war for the establishment of the independence of the Confederate
      States, as well as from the published observations of Dr. Trotter, Sir
      Gilbert Blane, and others of the English navy and army, it is evident that
      the scorbutic condition of the system, especially in crowded ships and
      camps, is most favorable to the origin and spread of foul ulcers and
      hospital gangrene. As in the present case of Andersonville, so also in
      past times when medical hygiene was almost entirely neglected, those two
      diseases were almost universally associated in crowded ships. In many
      cases it was very difficult to decide at first whether the ulcer was a
      simple result of scurvy or of the action of the prison or hospital
      gangrene, for there was great similarity in the appearance of the ulcers
      in the two diseases. So commonly have those two diseases been combined in
      their origin and action, that the description of scorbutic ulcers, by many
      authors, evidently includes also many of the prominent characteristics of
      hospital gangrene. This will be rendered evident by an examination of the
      observations of Dr. Lind and Sir Gilbert Blane upon scorbutic ulcers.
    </p>
    <p>
      6th. Gangrenous spots followed by rapid destruction of tissue appeared in
      some cases where there had been no known wound. Without such
      well-established facts, it might be assumed that the disease was
      propagated from one patient to another. In such a filthy and crowded
      hospital as that of the Confederate States Military Prison at
      Andersonville, it was impossible to isolate the wounded from the sources
      of actual contact of the gangrenous matter. The flies swarming over the
      wounds and over filth of every kind, the filthy, imperfectly washed and
      scanty supplies of rags, and the limited supply of washing utensils, the
      same wash-bowl serving for scores of patients, were sources of such
      constant circulation of the gangrenous matter that the disease might
      rapidly spread from a single gangrenous wound. The fact already stated,
      that a form of moist gangrene, resembling hospital gangrene, was quite
      common in this foul atmosphere, in cases of dysentery, both with and
      without the existence of the disease upon the entire surface, not only
      demonstrates the dependence of the disease upon the state of the
      constitution, but proves in the clearest manner that neither the contact
      of the poisonous matter of gangrene, nor the direct action of the
      poisonous atmosphere upon the ulcerated surfaces is necessary to the
      development of the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      7th. In this foul atmosphere amputation did not arrest hospital gangrene;
      the disease almost invariably returned. Almost every amputation was
      followed finally by death, either from the effects of gangrene or from the
      prevailing diarrhea and dysentery. Nitric acid and escharotics generally
      in this crowded atmosphere, loaded with noxious effluvia, exerted only
      temporary effects; after their application to the diseased surfaces, the
      gangrene would frequently return with redoubled energy; and even after the
      gangrene had been completely removed by local and constitutional
      treatment, it would frequently return and destroy the patient. As far as
      my observation extended, very few of the cases of amputation for gangrene
      recovered. The progress of these cases was frequently very deceptive. I
      have observed after death the most extensive disorganization of the
      structures of the stump, when during life there was but little swelling of
      the part, and the patient was apparently doing well. I endeavored to
      impress upon the medical officers the view that in this disease treatment
      was almost useless, without an abundant supply of pure, fresh air,
      nutritious food, and tonics and stimulants. Such changes, however, as
      would allow of the isolation of the cases of hospital gangrene appeared to
      be out of the power of the medical officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      8th. The gangrenous mass was without true pus, and consisted chiefly of
      broken-down, disorganized structures. The reaction of the gangrenous
      matter in certain stages was alkaline.
    </p>
    <p>
      9th. The best, and in truth the only means of protecting large armies and
      navies, as well as prisoners, from the ravages of hospital gangrene, is to
      furnish liberal supplies of well-cured meat, together with fresh beef and
      vegetables, and to enforce a rigid system of hygiene.
    </p>
    <p>
      10th. Finally, this gigantic mass of human misery calls loudly for relief,
      not only for the sake of suffering humanity, but also on account of our
      own brave soldiers now captives in the hands of the Federal Government.
      Strict justice to the gallant men of the Confederate Armies, who have been
      or who may be, so unfortunate as to be compelled to surrender in battle,
      demands that the Confederate Government should adopt that course which
      will best secure their health and comfort in captivity; or at least leave
      their enemies without a shadow of an excuse for any violation of the rules
      of civilized warfare in the treatment of prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      [End of the Witness's Testimony.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The variation&mdash;from month to month&mdash;of the proportion of deaths
      to the whole number living is singular and interesting. It supports the
      theory I have advanced above, as the following facts, taken from the
      official report, will show:
    </p>
    <table summary="" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto">
      <tr>
        <td>
          In April one in every sixteen died.<br /> In May one in every
          twenty-six died.<br /> In June one in every twenty-two died.<br /> In
          July one in every eighteen died.<br /> In August one in every eleven
          died.<br /> In September one in every three died.<br /> In October one
          in every two died.<br /> In November one in every three died.<br />
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Does the reader fully understand that in September one-third of those in
      the pen died, that in October one-half of the remainder perished, and in
      November one-third of those who still survived, died? Let him pause for a
      moment and read this over carefully again; because its startling magnitude
      will hardly dawn upon him at first reading. It is true that the fearfully
      disproportionate mortality of those months was largely due to the fact
      that it was mostly the sick that remained behind, but even this diminishes
      but little the frightfulness of the showing. Did any one ever hear of an
      epidemic so fatal that one-third of those attacked by it in one month
      died; one-half of the remnant the next month, and one-third of the feeble
      remainder the next month? If he did, his reading has been much more
      extensive than mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest number of deaths in one day is reported to have occurred on
      the 23d of August, when one hundred and twenty-seven died, or one man
      every eleven minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest number of prisoners in the Stockade is stated to have been
      August 8, when there were thirty-three thousand one hundred and fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always imagined both these statements to be short of the truth,
      because my remembrance is that one day in August I counted over two
      hundred dead lying in a row. As for the greatest number of prisoners, I
      remember quite distinctly standing by the ration wagon during the whole
      time of the delivery of rations, to see how many prisoners there really
      were inside. That day the One Hundred and Thirty-Third Detachment was
      called, and its Sergeant came up and drew rations for a full detachment.
      All the other detachments were habitually kept full by replacing those who
      died with new comers. As each detachment consisted of two hundred and
      seventy men, one hundred and thirty-three detachments would make
      thirty-five thousand nine hundred and ten, exclusive of those in the
      hospital, and those detailed outside as cooks, clerks, hospital attendants
      and various other employments&mdash;say from one to two thousand more.

      DIFFICULTY OF EXERCISING&mdash;EMBARRASSMENTS OF A MORNING WALK&mdash;THE
      RIALTO OF THE PRISON&mdash;CURSING THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY&mdash;THE
      STORY OF THE BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA COURTHOUSE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, in no other great community, that ever existed upon the face of
      the globe was there so little daily ebb and flow as in this. Dull as an
      ordinary Town or City may be; however monotonous, eventless, even stupid
      the lives of its citizens, there is yet, nevertheless, a flow every day of
      its life-blood&mdash;its population towards its heart, and an ebb of the
      same, every evening towards its extremities. These recurring tides mingle
      all classes together and promote the general healthfulness, as the
      constant motion hither and yon of the ocean's waters purify and sweeten
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of these helped vastly to make the living mass inside the
      Stockade a human Dead Sea&mdash;or rather a Dying Sea&mdash;a putrefying,
      stinking lake, resolving itself into phosphorescent corruption, like those
      rotting southern seas, whose seething filth burns in hideous reds, and
      ghastly greens and yellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being little call for motion of any kind, and no room to exercise whatever
      wish there might be in that direction, very many succumbed unresistingly
      to the apathy which was so strongly favored by despondency and the
      weakness induced by continual hunger, and lying supinely on the hot sand,
      day in and day out, speedily brought themselves into such a condition as
      invited the attacks of disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required both determination and effort to take a little walking
      exercise. The ground was so densely crowded with holes and other devices
      for shelter that it took one at least ten minutes to pick his way through
      the narrow and tortuous labyrinth which served as paths for communication
      between different parts of the Camp. Still further, there was nothing to
      see anywhere or to form sufficient inducement for any one to make so
      laborious a journey. One simply encountered at every new step the same
      unwelcome sights that he had just left; there was a monotony in the misery
      as in everything else, and consequently the temptation to sit or lie still
      in one's own quarters became very great.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to make it a point to go to some of the remoter parts of the
      Stockade once every day, simply for exercise. One can gain some idea of
      the crowd, and the difficulty of making one's way through it, when I say
      that no point in the prison could be more than fifteen hundred feet from
      where I staid, and, had the way been clear, I could have walked thither
      and back in at most a half an hour, yet it usually took me from two to
      three hours to make one of these journeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      This daily trip, a few visits to the Creek to wash all over, a few games
      of chess, attendance upon roll call, drawing rations, cooking and eating
      the same, "lousing" my fragments of clothes, and doing some little duties
      for my sick and helpless comrades, constituted the daily routine for
      myself, as for most of the active youths in the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Creek was the great meeting point for all inside the Stockade. All
      able to walk were certain to be there at least once during the day, and we
      made it a rendezvous, a place to exchange gossip, discuss the latest news,
      canvass the prospects of exchange, and, most of all, to curse the Rebels.
      Indeed no conversation ever progressed very far without both speaker and
      listener taking frequent rests to say bitter things as to the Rebels
      generally, and Wirz, Winder and Davis in particular.

    <p>
      A conversation between two boys&mdash;strangers to each other who came to
      the Creek to wash themselves or their clothes, or for some other purpose,
      would progress thus: <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp325" id="linkp325"></a>

      First Boy&mdash;"I belong to the Second Corps,&mdash;Hancock's, [the Army
      of the Potomac boys always mentioned what Corps they belonged to, where
      the Western boys stated their Regiment.] They got me at Spottsylvania,
      when they were butting their heads against our breast-works, trying to get
      even with us for gobbling up Johnson in the morning,"&mdash;He stops
      suddenly and changes tone to say: "I hope to God, that when our folks get
      Richmond, they will put old Ben Butler in command of it, with orders to
      limb, skin and jayhawk it worse than he did New Orleans."
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Boy, (fervently :) "I wish to God he would, and that he'd catch old
      Jeff., and that grayheaded devil, Winder, and the old Dutch Captain, strip
      'em just as we were, put 'em in this pen, with just the rations they are
      givin' us, and set a guard of plantation niggers over 'em, with orders to
      blow their whole infernal heads off, if they dared so much as to look at
      the dead line."
    </p>
    <p>
      First Boy&mdash;(returning to the story of his capture.) "Old Hancock
      caught the Johnnies that morning the neatest you ever saw anything in your
      life. After the two armies had murdered each other for four or five days
      in the Wilderness, by fighting so close together that much of the time you
      could almost shake hands with the Graybacks, both hauled off a little, and
      lay and glowered at each other. Each side had lost about twenty thousand
      men in learning that if it attacked the other it would get mashed fine. So
      each built a line of works and lay behind them, and tried to nag the other
      into coming out and attacking. At Spottsylvania our lines and those of the
      Johnnies weren't twelve hundred yards apart. The ground was clear and
      clean between them, and any force that attempted to cross it to attack
      would be cut to pieces, as sure as anything. We laid there three or four
      days watching each other&mdash;just like boys at school, who shake fists
      and dare each other. At one place the Rebel line ran out towards us like
      the top of a great letter 'A.' The night of the 11th of May it rained very
      hard, and then came a fog so thick that you couldn't see the length of a
      company. Hancock thought he'd take advantage of this. We were all turned
      out very quietly about four o'clock in the morning. Not a bit of noise was
      allowed. We even had to take off our canteens and tin cups, that they
      might not rattle against our bayonets. The ground was so wet that our
      footsteps couldn't be heard. It was one of those deathly, still movements,
      when you think your heart is making as much noise as a bass drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Johnnies didn't seem to have the faintest suspicion of what was
      coming, though they ought, because we would have expected such an attack
      from them if we hadn't made it ourselves. Their pickets were out just a
      little ways from their works, and we were almost on to them before they
      discovered us. They fired and ran back. At this we raised a yell and
      dashed forward at a charge. As we poured over the works, the Rebels came
      double-quicking up to defend them. We flanked Johnson's Division quicker'n
      you could say 'Jack Robinson,' and had four thousand of 'em in our grip
      just as nice as you please. We sent them to the rear under guard, and
      started for the next line of Rebel works about a half a mile away. But we
      had now waked up the whole of Lee's army, and they all came straight for
      us, like packs of mad wolves. Ewell struck us in the center; Longstreet
      let drive at our left flank, and Hill tackled our right. We fell back to
      the works we had taken, Warren and Wright came up to help us, and we had
      it hot and heavy for the rest of the day and part of the night. The
      Johnnies seemed so mad over what we'd done that they were half crazy. They
      charged us five times, coming up every time just as if they were going to
      lift us right out of the works with the bayonet. About midnight, after
      they'd lost over ten thousand men, they seemed to understand that we had
      pre-empted that piece of real estate, and didn't propose to allow anybody
      to jump our claim, so they fell back sullen like to their main works. When
      they came on the last charge, our Brigadier walked behind each of our
      regiments and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boys, we'll send 'em back this time for keeps. Give it to 'em by the
      acre, and when they begin to waver, we'll all jump over the works and go
      for them with the bayonet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We did it just that way. We poured such a fire on them that the bullets
      knocked up the ground in front just like you have seen the deep dust in a
      road in the middle of Summer fly up when the first great big drops of a
      rain storm strike it. But they came on, yelling and swearing, officers in
      front waving swords, and shouting&mdash;all that business, you know. When
      they got to about one hundred yards from us, they did not seem to be
      coming so fast, and there was a good deal of confusion among them. The
      brigade bugle sounded:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop firing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all ceased instantly. The rebels looked up in astonishment. Our
      General sang out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fix bayonets!' but we knew what was coming, and were already executing
      the order. You can imagine the crash that ran down the line, as every
      fellow snatched his bayonet out and slapped it on the muzzle of his gun.
      Then the General's voice rang out like a bugle:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready!&mdash;FORWARD! CHARGE!' <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp328"

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "We cheered till everything seemed to split, and jumped over the works,
      almost every man at the same minute. The Johnnies seemed to have been
      puzzled at the stoppage of our fire. When we all came sailing over the
      works, with guns brought right, down where they meant business, they were
      so astonished for a minute that they stood stock still, not knowing
      whether to come for us, or run. We did not allow them long to debate, but
      went right towards them on the double quick, with the bayonets looking
      awful savage and hungry. It was too much for Mr. Johnny Reb's nerves. They
      all seemed to about face' at once, and they lit out of there as if they
      had been sent for in a hurry. We chased after 'em as fast as we could, and
      picked up just lots of 'em. Finally it began to be real funny. A Johnny's
      wind would begin to give out he'd fall behind his comrades; he'd hear us
      yell and think that we were right behind him, ready to sink a bayonet
      through him'; he'd turn around, throw up his hands, and sing out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I surrender, mister! I surrender!' and find that we were a hundred feet
      off, and would have to have a bayonet as long as one of McClellan's
      general orders to touch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my company was the left of our regiment, and our regiment was the
      left of the brigade, and we swung out ahead of all the rest of the boys.
      In our excitement of chasing the Johnnies, we didn't see that we had
      passed an angle of their works. About thirty of us had become separated
      from the company and were chasing a squad of about seventy-five or one
      hundred. We had got up so close to them that we hollered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Halt there, now, or we'll blow your heads off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "They turned round with, 'halt yourselves; you &mdash;&mdash; Yankee
      &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We looked around at this, and saw that we were not one hundred feet away
      from the angle of the works, which were filled with Rebels waiting for our
      fellows to get to where they could have a good flank fire upon them. There
      was nothing to do but to throw down our guns and surrender, and we had
      hardly gone inside of the works, until the Johnnies opened on our brigade
      and drove it back. This ended the battle at Spottsylvania Court House."
    </p>

      Second Boy (irrelevantly.) "Some day the underpinning will fly out from
      under the South, and let it sink right into the middle kittle o' hell."

      First Boy (savagely.) "I only wish the whole Southern Confederacy was
      hanging over hell by a single string, and I had a knife." <br /><br /><br /><br />

    </h2>
    <p>
      REBEL MUSIC&mdash;SINGULAR LACK OF THE CREATIVE POWER AMONG THE
      SOUTHERNERS &mdash;CONTRAST WITH SIMILAR PEOPLE ELSEWHERE&mdash;THEIR
      FAVORITE MUSIC, AND WHERE IT WAS BORROWED FROM&mdash;A FIFER WITH ONE
      TUNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have before mentioned as among the things that grew upon one with
      increasing acquaintance with the Rebels on their native heath, was
      astonishment at their lack of mechanical skill and at their inability to
      grapple with numbers and the simpler processes of arithmetic. Another
      characteristic of the same nature was their wonderful lack of musical
      ability, or of any kind of tuneful creativeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsewhere, all over the world, people living under similar conditions to
      the Southerners are exceedingly musical, and we owe the great majority of
      the sweetest compositions which delight the ear and subdue the senses to
      unlettered song-makers of the Swiss mountains, the Tyrolese valleys, the
      Bavarian Highlands, and the minstrels of Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music of English-speaking people is very largely made up of these
      contributions from the folk-songs of dwellers in the wilder and more
      mountainous parts of the British Isles. One rarely goes far out of the way
      in attributing to this source any air that he may hear that captivates him
      with its seductive opulence of harmony. Exquisite melodies, limpid and
      unstrained as the carol of a bird in Spring-time, and as plaintive as the
      cooing of a turtle-dove seems as natural products of the Scottish
      Highlands as the gorse which blazons on their hillsides in August.
      Debarred from expressing their aspirations as people of broader culture do&mdash;in
      painting, in sculpture, in poetry and prose, these mountaineers make song
      the flexible and ready instrument for the communication of every emotion
      that sweeps across their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love, hatred, grief, revenge, anger, and especially war seems to tune
      their minds to harmony, and awake the voice of song in them hearts. The
      battles which the Scotch and Irish fought to replace the luckless Stuarts
      upon the British throne&mdash;the bloody rebellions of 1715 and 1745, left
      a rich legacy of sweet song, the outpouring of loving, passionate loyalty
      to a wretched cause; songs which are today esteemed and sung wherever the
      English language is spoken, by people who have long since forgotten what
      burning feelings gave birth to their favorite melodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a century the bones of both the Pretenders have moldered in alien
      soil; the names of James Edward, and Charles Edward, which were once
      trumpet blasts to rouse armed men, mean as little to the multitude of
      today as those of the Saxon Ethelbert, and Danish Hardicanute, yet the
      world goes on singing&mdash;and will probably as long as the English
      language is spoken&mdash;"Wha'll be King but Charlie?" "When Jamie Come
      Hame," "Over the Water to Charlie," "Charlie is my Darling," "The Bonny
      Blue Bonnets are Over the Border," "Saddle Your Steeds and Awa," and a
      myriad others whose infinite tenderness and melody no modern composer can
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet these same Scotch and Irish, the same Jacobite English, transplanted
      on account of their chronic rebelliousness to the mountains of Virginia,
      the Carolinas, and Georgia, seem to have lost their tunefulness, as some
      fine singing birds do when carried from their native shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descendants of those who drew swords for James and Charles at Preston
      Pans and Culloden dwell to-day in the dales and valleys of the Alleganies,
      as their fathers did in the dales and valleys of the Grampians, but their
      voices are mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule the Southerners are fond of music. They are fond of singing and
      listening to old-fashioned ballads, most of which have never been printed,
      but handed down from one generation to the other, like the 'Volklieder' of
      Germany. They sing these with the wild, fervid impressiveness
      characteristic of the ballad singing of unlettered people. Very many play
      tolerably on the violin and banjo, and occasionally one is found whose
      instrumentation may be called good. But above this hight they never soar.
      The only musician produced by the South of whom the rest of the country
      has ever heard, is Blind Tom, the negro idiot. No composer, no song writer
      of any kind has appeared within the borders of Dixie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a disappointment to me that even the stress of the war, the passion
      and fierceness with which the Rebels felt and fought, could not stimulate
      any adherent of the Stars and Bars into the production of a single lyric
      worthy in the remotest degree of the magnitude of the struggle, and the
      depth of the popular feeling. Where two million Scotch, fighting to
      restore the fallen fortunes of the worse than worthless Stuarts, filled
      the world with immortal music, eleven million of Southerners, fighting for
      what they claimed to be individual freedom and national life, did not
      produce any original verse, or a bar of music that the world could
      recognize as such. This is the fact; and an undeniable one. Its
      explanation I must leave to abler analysts than I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      Searching for peculiar causes we find but two that make the South differ
      from the ancestral home of these people. These two were Climate and
      Slavery. Climatic effects will not account for the phenomenon, because we
      see that the peasantry of the mountains of Spain and the South of France
      as ignorant as these people, and dwellers in a still more enervating
      atmosphere-are very fertile in musical composition, and their songs are to
      the Romanic languages what the Scotch and Irish ballads are to the
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it must be ascribed to the incubus of Slavery upon the intellect,
      which has repressed this as it has all other healthy growths in the South.
      Slavery seems to benumb all the faculties except the passions. The fact
      that the mountaineers had but few or no slaves, does not seem to be of
      importance in the case. They lived under the deadly shadow of the upas
      tree, and suffered the consequences of its stunting their development in
      all directions, as the ague-smitten inhabitant of the Roman Campana finds
      every sense and every muscle clogged by the filtering in of the insidious
      miasma. They did not compose songs and music, because they did not have
      the intellectual energy for that work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negros displayed all the musical creativeness of that section. Their
      wonderful prolificness in wild, rude songs, with strangely melodious airs
      that burned themselves into the memory, was one of the salient
      characteristics of that down-trodden race. Like the Russian serfs, and the
      bondmen of all ages and lands, the songs they made and sang all had an
      undertone of touching plaintiveness, born of ages of dumb suffering. The
      themes were exceedingly simple, and the range of subjects limited. The
      joys, and sorrows, hopes and despairs of love's gratification or
      disappointment, of struggles for freedom, contests with malign persons and
      influences, of rage, hatred, jealousy, revenge, such as form the motifs
      for the majority of the poetry of free and strong races, were wholly
      absent from their lyrics. Religion, hunger and toil were their main
      inspiration. They sang of the pleasures of idling in the genial sunshine;
      the delights of abundance of food; the eternal happiness that awaited them
      in the heavenly future, where the slave-driver ceased from troubling and
      the weary were at rest; where Time rolled around in endless cycles of days
      spent in basking, harp in hand, and silken clad, in golden streets, under
      the soft effulgence of cloudless skies, glowing with warmth and kindness
      emanating from the Creator himself. Had their masters condescended to
      borrow the music of the slaves, they would have found none whose
      sentiments were suitable for the ode of a people undergoing the pangs of
      what was hoped to be the birth of a new nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three songs most popular at the South, and generally regarded as
      distinctively Southern, were "The Bonnie Blue Flag," "Maryland, My
      Maryland," and "Stonewall Jackson Crossing into Maryland." The first of
      these was the greatest favorite by long odds. Women sang, men whistled,
      and the so-called musicians played it wherever we went. While in the field
      before capture, it was the commonest of experiences to have Rebel women
      sing it at us tauntingly from the house that we passed or near which we
      stopped. If ever near enough a Rebel camp, we were sure to hear its
      wailing crescendo rising upon the air from the lips or instruments of some
      one more quartered there. At Richmond it rang upon us constantly from some
      source or another, and the same was true wherever else we went in the
      so-called Confederacy. I give the air and words below: <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <a name="linkp334" id="linkp334"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      All familiar with Scotch songs will readily recognize the name and air as
      an old friend, and one of the fierce Jacobite melodies that for a long
      time disturbed the tranquility of the Brunswick family on the English
      throne. The new words supplied by the Rebels are the merest doggerel, and
      fit the music as poorly as the unchanged name of the song fitted to its
      new use. The flag of the Rebellion was not a bonnie blue one; but had
      quite as much red and white as azure. It did not have a single star, but
      thirteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near in popularity was "Maryland, My Maryland." The versification of this
      was of a much higher Order, being fairly respectable. The air is old, and
      a familiar one to all college students, and belongs to one of the most
      common of German household songs:

      "Stonewall Jackson Crossing into Maryland," was another travesty, of about
      the same literary merit, or rather demerit, as "The Bonnie Blue Flag." Its
      air was that of the well-known and popular negro minstrel song, "Billy
      Patterson." For all that, it sounded very martial and stirring when played
      by a brass band.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard these songs with tiresome iteration, daily and nightly, during
      our stay in the Southern Confederacy. Some one of the guards seemed to be
      perpetually beguiling the weariness of his watch by singing in all keys,
      in every sort of a voice, and with the wildest latitude as to air and
      time. They became so terribly irritating to us, that to this day the
      remembrance of those soul-lacerating lyrics abides with me as one of the
      chief of the minor torments of our situation. They were, in fact, nearly
      as bad as the lice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We revenged ourselves as best we could by constructing fearfully wicked,
      obscene and insulting parodies on these, and by singing them with
      irritating effusiveness in the hearing of the guards who were inflicting
      these nuisances upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the same nature was the garrison music. One fife, played by an
      asthmatic old fellow whose breathings were nearly as audible as his notes,
      and one rheumatic drummer, constituted the entire band for the post. The
      fifer actually knew but one tune "The Bonnie Blue Flag" &mdash;and did not
      know that well. But it was all that he had, and he played it with
      wearisome monotony for every camp call&mdash;five or six times a day, and
      seven days in the week. He called us up in the morning with it for a
      reveille; he sounded the "roll call" and "drill call," breakfast, dinner
      and supper with it, and finally sent us to bed, with the same dreary wail
      that had rung in our ears all day. I never hated any piece of music as I
      came to hate that threnody of treason. It would have been such a relief if
      the old asthmatic who played it could have been induced to learn another
      tune to play on Sundays, and give us one day of rest. He did not, but
      desecrated the Lord's Day by playing as vilely as on the rest of the week.
      The Rebels were fully conscious of their musical deficiencies, and made
      repeated but unsuccessful attempts to induce the musicians among the
      prisoners to come outside and form a band. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      "Illinoy," said tall, gaunt Jack North, of the One Hundred and Fourteenth

      The effects of the great bodily emaciation were sometimes very startling.
      Boys of a fleshy habit would change so in a few weeks as to lose all
      resemblance to their former selves, and comrades who came into prison
      later would utterly fail to recognize them. Most fat men, as most large
      men, died in a little while after entering, though there were exceptions.
      One of these was a boy of my own company, named George Hillicks. George
      had shot up within a few years to over six feet in hight, and then, as
      such boys occasionally do, had, after enlisting with us, taken on such a
      development of flesh that we nicknamed him the "Giant," and he became a
      pretty good load for even the strongest horse. George held his flesh
      through Belle Isle, and the earlier weeks in Andersonville, but June,
      July, and August "fetched him," as the boys said. He seemed to melt away
      like an icicle on a Spring day, and he grew so thin that his hight seemed
      preternatural. We called him "Flagstaff," and cracked all sorts of jokes
      about putting an insulator on his head, and setting him up for a telegraph
      pole, braiding his legs and using him for a whip lash, letting his hair
      grow a little longer, and trading him off to the Rebels for a sponge and
      staff for the artillery, etc. We all expected him to die, and looked
      continually for the development of the fatal scurvy symptoms, which were
      to seal his doom. But he worried through, and came out at last in good
      shape, a happy result due as much as to anything else to his having in
      Chester Hayward, of Prairie City, Ill.,&mdash;one of the most devoted
      chums I ever knew. Chester nursed and looked out for George with wife-like
      fidelity, and had his reward in bringing him safe through our lines. There
      were thousands of instances of this generous devotion to each other by
      chums in Andersonville, and I know of nothing that reflects any more
      credit upon our boy soldiers. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp339"

      There was little chance for any one to accumulate flesh on the rations we
      were receiving. I say it in all soberness that I do not believe that a
      healthy hen could have grown fat upon them. I am sure that any good-sized
      "shanghai" eats more every day than the meager half loaf that we had to
      maintain life upon. Scanty as this was, and hungry as all were, very many
      could not eat it. Their stomachs revolted against the trash; it became so
      nauseous to them that they could not force it down, even when famishing,
      and they died of starvation with the chunks of the so-called bread under
      their head. I found myself rapidly approaching this condition. I had been
      blessed with a good digestion and a talent for sleeping under the most
      discouraging circumstances. These, I have no doubt, were of the greatest
      assistance to me in my struggle for existence. But now the rations became
      fearfully obnoxious to me, and it was only with the greatest effort&mdash;pulling
      the bread into little pieces and swallowing each, of these as one would a
      pill&mdash;that I succeeded in worrying the stuff down. I had not as yet
      fallen away very much, but as I had never, up, to that time, weighed so
      much as one hundred and twenty-five pounds, there was no great amount of
      adipose to lose. It was evident that unless some change occurred my time
      was near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not only hunger for more food, but longing with an intensity
      beyond expression for alteration of some kind in the rations. The
      changeless monotony of the miserable saltless bread, or worse mush, for
      days, weeks and months, became unbearable. If those wretched mule teams
      had only once a month hauled in something different&mdash;if they had come
      in loaded with sweet potatos, green corn or wheat flour, there would be
      thousands of men still living who now slumber beneath those melancholy
      pines. It would have given something to look forward to, and remember when
      past. But to know each day that the gates would open to admit the same
      distasteful apologies for food took away the appetite and raised one's
      gorge, even while famishing for something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could for a while forget the stench, the lice, the heat, the maggots,
      the dead and dying around us, the insulting malignance of our jailors; but
      it was, very hard work to banish thoughts and longings for food from our
      minds. Hundreds became actually insane from brooding over it. Crazy men
      could be found in all parts of the camp. Numbers of them wandered around
      entirely naked. Their babblings and maunderings about something to eat
      were painful to hear. I have before mentioned the case of the Plymouth
      Pilgrim near me, whose insanity took the form of imagining that he was
      sitting at the table with his family, and who would go through the show of
      helping them to imaginary viands and delicacies. The cravings for green
      food of those afflicted with the scurvy were, agonizing. Large numbers of
      watermelons were brought to the prison, and sold to those who had the
      money to pay for them at from one to five dollars, greenbacks, apiece. A
      boy who had means to buy a piece of these would be followed about while
      eating it by a crowd of perhaps twenty-five or thirty livid-gummed
      scorbutics, each imploring him for the rind when he was through with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We thought of food all day, and were visited with torturing dreams of it
      at night. One of the pleasant recollections of my pre-military life was a
      banquet at the "Planter's House," St. Louis, at which I was a boyish
      guest. It was, doubtless, an ordinary affair, as banquets go, but to me
      then, with all the keen appreciation of youth and first experience, it was
      a feast worthy of Lucullus. But now this delightful reminiscence became a
      torment. Hundreds of times I dreamed I was again at the "Planter's." I saw
      the wide corridors, with their mosaic pavement; I entered the grand
      dining-room, keeping timidly near the friend to whose kindness I owed this
      wonderful favor; I saw again the mirror-lined walls, the evergreen decked
      ceilings, the festoons and mottos, the tables gleaming with cutglass and
      silver, the buffets with wines and fruits, the brigade of sleek, black,
      white-aproned waiters, headed by one who had presence enough for a major
      General. Again I reveled in all the dainties and dishes on the
      bill-of-fare; calling for everything that I dared to, just to see what
      each was like, and to be able to say afterwards that I had partaken of it;
      all these bewildering delights of the first realization of what a boy has
      read and wondered much over, and longed for, would dance their rout and
      reel through my somnolent brain. Then I would awake to find myself a
      half-naked, half-starved, vermin-eaten wretch, crouching in a hole in the
      ground, waiting for my keepers to fling me a chunk of corn bread.

      Naturally the boys&mdash;and especially the country boys and new prisoners
      &mdash;talked much of victuals&mdash;what they had had, and what they
      would have again, when they got out. Take this as a sample of the
      conversation which might be heard in any group of boys, sitting together
      on the sand, killin lice and talking of exchange:
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&mdash;"Well, Bill, when we get back to God's country, you and Jim and
      John must all come to my house and take dinner with me. I want to give you
      a square meal. I want to show you just what good livin' is. You know my
      mother is just the best cook in all that section. When she lays herself
      out to get up a meal all the other women in the neighborhood just stand
      back and admire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill&mdash;"O, that's all right; but I'll bet she can't hold a candle to
      my mother, when it comes to good cooking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim&mdash;"No, nor to mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      John&mdash;(with patronizing contempt.) "O, shucks! None of you fellers
      were ever at our house, even when we had one of our common weekday
      dinners."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&mdash;(unheedful of the counter claims.) I hev teen studyin' up the
      dinner I'd like, and the bill-of-fare I'd set out for you fellers when you
      come over to see me. First, of course, we'll lay the foundation like with
      a nice, juicy loin roast, and some mashed potatos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill&mdash;(interrupting.) "Now, do you like mashed potatos with beef? The
      way may mother does is to pare the potatos, and lay them in the pan along
      with the beef. Then, you know, they come out just as nice and crisp, and
      brown; they have soaked up all the beef gravy, and they crinkle between
      your teeth&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim&mdash;"Now, I tell you, mashed Neshannocks with butter on 'em is
      plenty good enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      John&mdash;"If you'd et some of the new kind of peachblows that we raised
      in the old pasture lot the year before I enlisted, you'd never say another
      word about your Neshannocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&mdash;(taking breath and starting in fresh.) "Then we'll hev some
      fried Spring chickens, of our dominick breed. Them dominicks of ours have
      the nicest, tenderest meat, better'n quail, a darned sight, and the way my
      mother can fry Spring chickens&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill&mdash;(aside to Jim.) "Every durned woman in the country thinks she
      can 'spry ching frickens;' but my mother&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      John&mdash;"You fellers all know that there's nobody knows half as much
      about chicken doin's as these 'tinerant Methodis' preachers. They give 'em
      chicken wherever they go, and folks do say that out in the new settlements
      they can't get no preachin', no gospel, nor nothin', until the chickens
      become so plenty that a preacher is reasonably sure of havin' one for his
      dinner wherever he may go. Now, there's old Peter Cartwright, who has
      traveled over Illinoy and Indianny since the Year One, and preached more
      good sermons than any other man who ever set on saddle-bags, and has et
      more chickens than there are birds in a big pigeon roost. Well, he took
      dinner at our house when he came up to dedicate the big, white church at
      Simpkin's Corners, and when he passed up his plate the third time for more
      chicken, he sez, sez he:&mdash;I've et at a great many hundred tables in
      the fifty years I have labored in the vineyard of the Redeemer, but I must
      say, Mrs. Kiggins, that your way of frying chickens is a leetle the nicest
      that I ever knew. I only wish that the sisters generally would get your
      reseet.' Yes, that's what he said,&mdash;'a leetle the nicest.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&mdash;"An' then, we'll hev biscuits an' butter. I'll just bet five
      hundred dollars to a cent, and give back the cent if I win, that we have
      the best butter at our house that there is in Central Illinoy. You can't
      never hev good butter onless you have a spring house; there's no use of
      talkin'&mdash;all the patent churns that lazy men ever invented&mdash;all
      the fancy milk pans an' coolers, can't make up for a spring house.
      Locations for a spring house are scarcer than hen's teeth in Illinoy, but
      we hev one, and there ain't a better one in Orange County, New York. Then
      you'll see dome of the biscuits my mother makes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill&mdash;"Well, now, my mother's a boss biscuit-maker, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim&mdash;"You kin just gamble that mine is."
    </p>
    <p>
      John&mdash;"O, that's the way you fellers ought to think an' talk, but my
      mother&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&mdash;(coming in again with fresh vigor) "They're jest as light an'
      fluffy as a dandelion puff, and they melt in your month like a ripe
      Bartlett pear. You just pull 'em open&mdash;Now you know that I think
      there's nothin' that shows a person's raisin' so well as to see him eat
      biscuits an' butter. If he's been raised mostly on corn bread, an' common
      doins,' an' don't know much about good things to eat, he'll most likely
      cut his biscuit open with a case knife, an' make it fall as flat as one o'
      yesterday's pancakes. But if he is used to biscuits, has had 'em often at
      his house, he'll&mdash;just pull 'em open, slow an' easy like, then he'll
      lay a little slice of butter inside, and drop a few drops of clear honey
      on this, an' stick the two halves back, together again, an&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, for God Almighty's sake, stop talking that infernal nonsense," roar
      out a half dozen of the surrounding crowd, whose mouths have been watering
      over this unctuous recital of the good things of the table. "You blamed
      fools, do you want to drive yourselves and everybody else crazy with such
      stuff as that. Dry up and try to think of something else." <br /><br /><br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      Early in August, F. Marriott, our Company Bugler, died. Previous to coming
      to America he had been for many years an English soldier, and I accepted
      him as a type of that stolid, doggedly brave class, which forms the bulk
      of the English armies, and has for centuries carried the British flag with
      dauntless courage into every land under the sun. Rough, surly and
      unsocial, he did his duty with the unemotional steadiness of a machine. He
      knew nothing but to obey orders, and obeyed them under all circumstances
      promptly, but with stony impassiveness. With the command to move forward
      into action, he moved forward without a word, and with face as blank as a
      side of sole leather. He went as far as ordered, halted at the word, and
      retired at command as phlegmatically as he advanced. If he cared a straw
      whether he advanced or retreated, if it mattered to the extent of a pinch
      of salt whether we whipped the Rebels or they defeated us, he kept that
      feeling so deeply hidden in the recesses of his sturdy bosom that no one
      ever suspected it. In the excitement of action the rest of the boys
      shouted, and swore, and expressed their tense feelings in various ways,
      but Marriott might as well have been a graven image, for all the
      expression that he suffered to escape. Doubtless, if the Captain had
      ordered him to shoot one of the company through the heart, he would have
      executed the command according to the manual of arms, brought his carbine
      to a "recover," and at the word marched back to his quarters without an
      inquiry as to the cause of the proceedings. He made no friends, and though
      his surliness repelled us, he made few enemies. Indeed, he was rather a
      favorite, since he was a genuine character; his gruffness had no taint of
      selfish greed in it; he minded his own business strictly, and wanted
      others to do the same. When he first came into the company, it is true, he
      gained the enmity of nearly everybody in it, but an incident occurred
      which turned the tide in his favor. Some annoying little depredations had
      been practiced on the boys, and it needed but a word of suspicion to
      inflame all their minds against the surly Englishman as the unknown
      perpetrator. The feeling intensified, until about half of the company were
      in a mood to kill the Bugler outright. As we were returning from stable
      duty one evening, some little occurrence fanned the smoldering anger into
      a fierce blaze; a couple of the smaller boys began an attack upon him;
      others hastened to their assistance, and soon half the company were
      engaged in the assault. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp346"

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He succeeded in disengaging himself from his assailants, and, squaring
      himself off, said, defiantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dom yer cowardly heyes; jest come hat me one hat a time, hand hI'll
      wollop the 'ole gang uv ye's."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of our Sergeants styled himself proudly "a Chicago rough," and was as
      vain of his pugilistic abilities as a small boy is of a father who plays
      in the band. We all hated him cordially&mdash;even more than we did
      Marriott.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought this was a good time to show off, and forcing his way through
      the crowd, he said, vauntingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just fall back and form a ring, boys, and see me polish off the&mdash;-fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring was formed, with the Bugler and the Sergeant in the center.
      Though the latter was the younger and stronger the first round showed him
      that it would have profited him much more to have let Marriott's challenge
      pass unheeded. As a rule, it is as well to ignore all invitations of this
      kind from Englishmen, and especially from those who, like Marriott, have
      served a term in the army, for they are likely to be so handy with their
      fists as to make the consequences of an acceptance more lively than
      desirable.

      So the Sergeant found. "Marriott," as one of the spectators expressed it,
      "went around him like a cooper around a barrel." He planted his blows just
      where he wished, to the intense delight of the boys, who yelled
      enthusiastically whenever he got in "a hot one," and their delight at
      seeing the Sergeant drubbed so thoroughly and artistically, worked an
      entire revolution in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforward we viewed his eccentricities with lenient eyes, and became
      rather proud of his bull-dog stolidity and surliness. The whole battalion
      soon came to share this feeling, and everybody enjoyed hearing his
      deep-toned growl, which mischievous boys would incite by some petty
      annoyances deliberately designed for that purpose. I will mention
      incidentally, that after his encounter with the Sergeant no one ever again
      volunteered to "polish" him off.

      Andersonville did not improve either his temper or his communicativeness.
      He seemed to want to get as far away from the rest of us as possible, and
      took up his quarters in a remote corner of the Stockade, among utter
      strangers. Those of us who wandered up in his neighborhood occasionally,
      to see how he was getting along, were received with such scant courtesy,
      that we did not hasten to repeat the visit. At length, after none of us
      had seen him for weeks, we thought that comradeship demanded another
      visit. We found him in the last stages of scurvy and diarrhea. Chunks of
      uneaten corn bread lay by his head. They were at least a week old. The
      rations since then had evidently been stolen from the helpless man by
      those around him. The place where he lay was indescribably filthy, and his
      body was swarming with vermin. Some good Samaritan had filled his little
      black oyster can with water, and placed it within his reach. For a week,
      at least, he had not been able to rise from the ground; he could barely
      reach for the water near him. He gave us such a glare of recognition as I
      remembered to have seen light up the fast-darkening eyes of a savage old
      mastiff, that I and my boyish companions once found dying in the woods of
      disease and hurts. Had he been able he would have driven us away, or at
      least assailed us with biting English epithets. Thus he had doubtless
      driven away all those who had attempted to help him. We did what little we
      could, and staid with him until the next afternoon, when he died. We
      prepared his body, in the customary way: folded the hands across his
      breast, tied the toes together, and carried it outside, not forgetting
      each of us, to bring back a load of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scarcity of mechanics of all kinds in the Confederacy, and the urgent
      needs of the people for many things which the war and the blockade
      prevented their obtaining, led to continual inducements being offered to
      the artizans among us to go outside and work at their trade. Shoemakers
      seemed most in demand; next to these blacksmiths, machinists, molders and
      metal workers generally. Not a week passed during my imprisonment that I
      did not see a Rebel emissary of some kind about the prison seeking to
      engage skilled workmen for some purpose or another. While in Richmond the
      managers of the Tredegar Iron Works were brazen and persistent in their
      efforts to seduce what are termed "malleable iron workers," to enter their
      employ. A boy who was master of any one of the commoner trades had but to
      make his wishes known, and he would be allowed to go out on parole to
      work. I was a printer, and I think that at least a dozen times I was
      approached by Rebel publishers with offers of a parole, and work at good
      prices. One from Columbia, S. C., offered me two dollars and a half a
      "thousand" for composition. As the highest price for such work that I had
      received before enlisting was thirty cents a thousand, this seemed a
      chance to accumulate untold wealth. Since a man working in day time can
      set from thirty-five to fifty "thousand" a week, this would make weekly
      wages run from eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents to one hundred and
      twenty-five dollars&mdash;but it was in Confederate money, then worth from
      ten to twenty cents on the dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still better offers were made to iron workers of all kinds, to shoemakers,
      tanners, weavers, tailors, hatters, engineers, machinists, millers,
      railroad men, and similar tradesmen. Any of these could have made a
      handsome thing by accepting the offers made them almost weekly. As nearly
      all in the prison had useful trades, it would have been of immense benefit
      to the Confederacy if they could have been induced to work at them. There
      is no measuring the benefit it would have been to the Southern cause if
      all the hundreds of tanners and shoemakers in the Stockade could have,
      been persuaded to go outside and labor in providing leather and shoes for
      the almost shoeless people and soldiery. The machinists alone could have
      done more good to the Southern Confederacy than one of our brigades was
      doing harm, by consenting to go to the railroad shops at Griswoldville and
      ply their handicraft. The lack of material resources in the South was one
      of the strongest allies our arms had. This lack of resources was primarily
      caused by a lack of skilled labor to develop those resources, and nowhere
      could there be found a finer collection of skilled laborers than in the
      thirty-three thousand prisoners incarcerated in Andersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      All solicitations to accept a parole and go outside to work at one's trade
      were treated with the scorn they deserved. If any mechanic yielded to
      them, the fact did not come under my notice. The usual reply to
      invitations of this kind was:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sir! By God, I'll stay in here till I rot, and the maggots carry me
      out through the cracks in the Stockade, before I'll so much as raise my
      little finger to help the infernal Confederacy, or Rebels, in any shape or
      form."
    </p>
    <p>
      In August a Macon shoemaker came in to get some of his trade to go back
      with him to work in the Confederate shoe factory. He prosecuted his search
      for these until he reached the center of the camp on the North Side, when
      some of the shoemakers who had gathered around him, apparently considering
      his propositions, seized him and threw him into a well. He was kept there
      a whole day, and only released when Wirz cut off the rations of the prison
      for that day, and announced that no more would be issued until the man was
      returned safe and sound to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible crowding was somewhat ameliorated by the opening in July of
      an addition&mdash;six hundred feet long&mdash;to the North Side of the
      Stockade. This increased the room inside to twenty acres, giving about an
      acre to every one thousand seven hundred men,&mdash;a preposterously
      contracted area still. The new ground was not a hotbed of virulent poison
      like the olds however, and those who moved on to it had that much in their
      favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palisades between the new and the old portions of the pen were left
      standing when the new portion was opened. We were still suffering a great
      deal of inconvenience from lack of wood. That night the standing timbers
      were attacked by thousands of prisoners armed with every species of a tool
      to cut wood, from a case-knife to an ax. They worked the live-long night
      with such energy that by morning not only every inch of the logs above
      ground had disappeared, but that below had been dug up, and there was not
      enough left of the eight hundred foot wall of twenty-five-foot logs to
      make a box of matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon&mdash;early in August&mdash;one of the violent rain storms
      common to that section sprung up, and in a little while the water was
      falling in torrents. The little creek running through the camp swelled up
      immensely, and swept out large gaps in the Stockade, both in the west and
      east sides. The Rebels noticed the breaches as soon as the prisoners. Two
      guns were fired from the Star Tort, and all the guards rushed out, and
      formed so as to prevent any egress, if one was attempted. Taken by
      surprise, we were not in a condition to profit by the opportunity until it
      was too late. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp351" id="linkp351"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm did one good thing: it swept away a great deal of filth, and
      left the camp much more wholesome. The foul stench rising from the camp
      made an excellent electrical conductor, and the lightning struck several
      times within one hundred feet of the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the end of August there happened what the religously inclined
      termed a Providential Dispensation. The water in the Creek was
      indescribably bad. No amount of familiarity with it, no increase of
      intimacy with our offensive surroundings, could lessen the disgust at the
      polluted water. As I have said previously, before the stream entered the
      Stockade, it was rendered too filthy for any use by the contaminations
      from the camps of the guards, situated about a half-mile above.
      Immediately on entering the Stockade the contamination became terrible.
      The oozy seep at the bottom of the hillsides drained directly into it all
      the mass of filth from a population of thirty-three thousand. Imagine the
      condition of an open sewer, passing through the heart of a city of that
      many people, and receiving all the offensive product of so dense a
      gathering into a shallow, sluggish stream, a yard wide and five inches
      deep, and heated by the burning rays of the sun in the thirty-second
      degree of latitude. Imagine, if one can, without becoming sick at the
      stomach, all of these people having to wash in and drink of this foul
      flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not a scintilla of exaggeration in this statement. That it is
      within the exact truth is demonstrable by the testimony of any man&mdash;Rebel
      or Union&mdash;who ever saw the inside of the Stockade at Andersonville. I
      am quite content to have its truth&mdash;as well as that of any other
      statement made in this book&mdash;be determined by the evidence of any
      one, no matter how bitter his hatred of the Union, who had any personal
      knowledge of the condition of affairs at Andersonville. No one can
      successfully deny that there were at least thirty-three thousand prisoners
      in the Stockade, and that the one shallow, narrow creek, which passed
      through the prison, was at once their main sewer and their source of
      supply of water for bathing, drinking and washing. With these main facts
      admitted, the reader's common sense of natural consequences will furnish
      the rest of the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that some of the more fortunate of us had wells; thanks to our
      own energy in overcoming extraordinary obstacles; no thanks to our gaolers
      for making the slightest effort to provide these necessities of life. We
      dug the wells with case and pocket knives, and half canteens to a depth of
      from twenty to thirty feet, pulling up the dirt in pantaloons legs, and
      running continual risk of being smothered to death by the caving in of the
      unwalled sides. Not only did the Rebels refuse to give us boards with
      which to wall the wells, and buckets for drawing the water, but they did
      all in their power to prevent us from digging the wells, and made
      continual forays to capture the digging tools, because the wells were
      frequently used as the starting places for tunnels. Professor Jones lays
      special stress on this tunnel feature in his testimony, which I have
      introduced in a previous chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great majority of the prisoners who went to the Creek for water, went
      as near as possible to the Dead Line on the West Side, where the Creek
      entered the Stockade, that they might get water with as little filth in it
      as possible. In the crowds struggling there for their turn to take a dip,
      some one nearly every day got so close to the Dead Line as to arouse a
      suspicion in the guard's mind that he was touching it. The suspicion was
      the unfortunate one's death warrant, and also its execution. As the
      sluggish brain of the guard conceived it he leveled his gun; the distance
      to his victim was not over one hundred feet; he never failed his aim; the
      first warning the wretched prisoner got that he was suspected of
      transgressing a prison-rule was the charge of "ball-and-buck" that tore
      through his body. It was lucky if he was, the only one of the group
      killed. More wicked and unjustifiable murders never were committed than
      these almost daily assassinations at the Creek.

      One morning the camp was astonished beyond measure to discover that during
      the night a large, bold spring had burst out on the North Side, about
      midway between the Swamp and the summit of the hill. It poured out its
      grateful flood of pure, sweet water in an apparently exhaustless quantity.
      To the many who looked in wonder upon it, it seemed as truly a
      heaven-wrought miracle as when Moses's enchanted rod smote the parched
      rock in Sinai's desert waste, and the living waters gushed forth. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The police took charge of the spring, and every one was compelled to take
      his regular turn in filling his vessel. This was kept up during our whole
      stay in Andersonville, and every morning, shortly after daybreak, a
      thousand men could be seen standing in line, waiting their turns to fill
      their cans and cups with the precious liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am told by comrades who have revisited the Stockade of recent years,
      that the spring is yet running as when we left, and is held in most pious
      veneration by the negros of that vicinity, who still preserve the
      tradition of its miraculous origin, and ascribe to its water wonderful
      grace giving and healing properties, similar to those which pious
      Catholics believe exist in the holy water of the fountain at Lourdes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must confess that I do not think they are so very far from right. If I
      could believe that any water was sacred and thaumaturgic, it would be of
      that fountain which appeared so opportunely for the benefit of the
      perishing thousands of Andersonville. And when I hear of people bringing
      water for baptismal purposes from the Jordan, I say in my heart, "How much
      more would I value for myself and friends the administration of the
      chrismal sacrament with the diviner flow from that low sand-hill in
      Western Georgia." <br /><br /><br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning after roll-call, thousands of sick gathered at the South
      Gate, where the doctors made some pretense of affording medical relief.
      The scene there reminded me of the illustrations in my Sunday-School
      lessons of that time when "great multitudes came unto Him," by the shores
      of the Sea of Galilee, "having with them those that were lame, blind,
      dumb, maimed, and many others." Had the crowds worn the flouting robes of
      the East, the picture would have lacked nothing but the presence of the
      Son of Man to make it complete. Here were the burning sands and parching
      sun; hither came scores of groups of three or four comrades, laboriously
      staggering under the weight of a blanket in which they had carried a
      disabled and dying friend from some distant part of the Stockade. Beside
      them hobbled the scorbutics with swollen and distorted limbs, each more
      loathsome and nearer death than the lepers whom Christ's divine touch made
      whole. Dozens, unable to walk, and having no comrades to carry them,
      crawled painfully along, with frequent stops, on their hands and knees.
      Every form of intense physical suffering that it is possible for disease
      to induce in the human frame was visible at these daily parades of the
      sick of the prison. As over three thousand (three thousand and
      seventy-six) died in August, there were probably twelve thousand
      dangerously sick at any given time daring the month; and a large part of
      these collected at the South Gate every morning. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Measurably-calloused as we had become by the daily sights of horror around
      us, we encountered spectacles in these gatherings which no amount of
      visible misery could accustom us to. I remember one especially that burned
      itself deeply into my memory. It was of a young man not over twenty-five,
      who a few weeks ago&mdash;his clothes looked comparatively new &mdash;had
      evidently been the picture of manly beauty and youthful vigor. He had had
      a well-knit, lithe form; dark curling hair fell over a forehead which had
      once been fair, and his eyes still showed that they had gleamed with a
      bold, adventurous spirit. The red clover leaf on his cap showed that he
      belonged to the First Division of the Second Corps, the three chevrons on
      his arm that he was a Sergeant, and the stripe at his cuff that he was a
      veteran. Some kind-hearted boys had found him in a miserable condition on
      the North Side, and carried him over in a blanket to where the doctors
      could see him. He had but little clothing on, save his blouse and cap.
      Ulcers of some kind had formed in his abdomen, and these were now masses
      of squirming worms. It was so much worse than the usual forms of
      suffering, that quite a little crowd of compassionate spectators gathered
      around and expressed their pity. The sufferer turned to one who lay beside
      him with:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade: If we were only under the old Stars and Stripes, we wouldn't
      care a G-d d&mdash;n for a few worms, would we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not profane. It was an utterance from the depths of a brave man's
      heart, couched in the strongest language at his command. It seemed
      terrible that so gallant a soul should depart from earth in this miserable
      fashion. Some of us, much moved by the sight, went to the doctors and put
      the case as strongly as possible, begging them to do something to
      alleviate his suffering. They declined to see the case, but got rid of us
      by giving us a bottle of turpentine, with directions to pour it upon the
      ulcers to kill the maggots. We did so. It must have been cruel torture,
      and as absurd remedially as cruel, but our hero set his teeth and endured,
      without a groan. He was then carried out to the hospital to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said the doctors made a pretense of affording medical relief. It was
      hardly that, since about all the prescription for those inside the
      Stockade consisted in giving a handful of sumach berries to each of those
      complaining of scurvy. The berries might have done some good, had there
      been enough of them, and had their action been assisted by proper food. As
      it was, they were probably nearly, if not wholly, useless. Nothing was
      given to arrest the ravages of dysentery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A limited number of the worst cases were admitted to the Hospital each
      day. As this only had capacity for about one-quarter of the sick in the
      Stockade, new patients could only be admitted as others died. It seemed,
      anyway, like signing a man's death warrant to send him to the Hospital, as
      three out of every four who went out there died. The following from the
      official report of the Hospital shows this: <br /><br />

    <p>
      Early in August I made a successful effort to get out to the Hospital. I
      had several reasons for this: First, one of my chums, W. W. Watts, of my
      own company, had been sent out a little whale before very sick with scurvy
      and pneumonia, and I wanted to see if I could do anything for him, if he
      still lived: I have mentioned before that for awhile after our entrance
      into Andersonville five of us slept on one overcoat and covered ourselves
      with one blanket. Two of these had already died, leaving as possessors
      of-the blanket and overcoat, W. W. Watts, B. B. Andrews, and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, I wanted to go out to see if there was any prospect of escape. I had
      long since given up hopes of escaping from the Stockade. All our attempts
      at tunneling had resulted in dead failures, and now, to make us wholly
      despair of success in that direction, another Stockade was built clear
      around the prison, at a distance of one hundred and twenty feet from the
      first palisades. It was manifest that though we might succeed in tunneling
      past one Stockade, we could not go beyond the second one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the scurvy rather badly, and being naturally slight in frame, I
      presented a very sick appearance to the physicians, and was passed out to
      the Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was a wretched affair, it was still a vast improvement on the
      Stockade. About five acres of ground, a little southeast of the Stockade,
      and bordering on a creek, were enclosed by a board fence, around which the
      guard walked, trees shaded the ground tolerably well. There were tents and
      flies to shelter part of the sick, and in these were beds made of pine
      leaves. There were regular streets and alleys running through the grounds,
      and as the management was in the hands of our own men, the place was kept
      reasonably clean and orderly for Andersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also some improvement in the food. Rice in some degree replaced
      the nauseous and innutritious corn bread, and if served in sufficient
      quantities, would doubtless have promoted the recovery of many men dying
      from dysenteric diseases. We also received small quantities of "okra," a
      plant peculiar to the South, whose pods contained a mucilaginous matter
      that made a soup very grateful to those suffering from scurvy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all these ameliorations of condition were too slight to even arrest
      the progress of the disease of the thousands of dying men brought out from
      the Stockade. These still wore the same lice-infested garments as in
      prison; no baths or even ordinary applications of soap and water cleaned
      their dirt-grimed skins, to give their pores an opportunity to assist in
      restoring them to health; even their long, lank and matted hair, swarming
      with vermin, was not trimmed. The most ordinary and obvious measures for
      their comfort and care were neglected. If a man recovered he did it almost
      in spite of fate. The medicines given were scanty and crude. The principal
      remedial agent&mdash;as far as my observation extended&mdash;was a rank,
      fetid species of unrectified spirits, which, I was told, was made from
      sorgum seed. It had a light-green tinge, and was about as inviting to the
      taste as spirits of turpentine. It was given to the sick in small
      quantities mixed with water. I had had some experience with Kentucky
      "apple-jack," which, it was popularly believed among the boys, would
      dissolve a piece of the fattest pork thrown into it, but that seemed balmy
      and oily alongside of this. After tasting some, I ceased to wonder at the
      atrocities of Wirz and his associates. Nothing would seem too bad to a man
      who made that his habitual tipple.
    </p>
    <p>
      [For a more particular description of the Hospital I must refer my reader
      to the testimony of Professor Jones, in a previous chapter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly this continent has never seen&mdash;and I fervently trust it
      will never again see&mdash;such a gigantic concentration of misery as that
      Hospital displayed daily. The official statistics tell the story of this
      with terrible brevity: There were three thousand seven hundred and nine in
      the Hospital in August; one thousand four hundred and eighty-nine&mdash;nearly
      every other man died. The rate afterwards became much higher than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most conspicuous suffering was in the gangrene wards. Horrible sores
      spreading almost visibly from hour to hour, devoured men's limbs and
      bodies. I remember one ward in which the alterations appeared to be
      altogether in the back, where they ate out the tissue between the skin and
      the ribs. The attendants seemed trying to arrest the progress of the
      sloughing by drenching the sores with a solution of blue vitriol. This was
      exquisitely painful, and in the morning, when the drenching was going on,
      the whole hospital rang with the most agonizing screams.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gangrene mostly attacked the legs and arms, and the led more than
      the arms. Sometimes it killed men inside of a week; sometimes they
      lingered on indefinitely. I remember one man in the Stockade who cut his
      hand with the sharp corner of a card of corn bread he was lifting from the
      ration wagon; gangrene set in immediately, and he died four days after.
    </p>
    <p>
      One form that was quit prevalent was a cancer of the lower one corner of
      the mouth, and it finally ate the whole side of the face out. Of course
      the sufferer had the greatest trouble in eating and drinking. For the
      latter it was customary to whittle out a little wooden tube, and fasten it
      in a tin cup, through which he could suck up the water. As this mouth
      cancer seemed contagious, none of us would allow any one afflicted with it
      to use any of our cooking utensils. The Rebel doctors at the hospital
      resorted to wholesale amputations to check the progress of the gangrene.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a two hours session of limb-lopping every morning, each of which
      resulted in quite a pile of severed members. I presume more bungling
      operations are rarely seen outside of Russian or Turkish hospitals. Their
      unskilfulness was apparent even to non-scientific observers like myself.
      The standard of medical education in the South&mdash;as indeed of every
      other form of education&mdash;was quite low. The Chief Surgeon of the
      prison, Dr. Isaiah White, and perhaps two or three others, seemed to be
      gentlemen of fair abilities and attainments. The remainder were of that
      class of illiterate and unlearning quacks who physic and blister the poor
      whites and negros in the country districts of the South; who believe they
      can stop bleeding of the nose by repeating a verse from the Bible; who
      think that if in gathering their favorite remedy of boneset they cut the
      stem upwards it will purge their patients, and if downward it will vomit
      them, and who hold that there is nothing so good for "fits" as a black
      cat, killed in the dark of the moon, cut open, and bound while yet warm,
      upon the naked chest of the victim of the convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a case of instruments captured from some of our field hospitals,
      which were dull and fearfully out of order. With poor instruments and
      unskilled hands the operations became mangling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Hospital I saw an admirable illustration of the affection which a
      sailor will lavish on a ship's boy, whom he takes a fancy to, and makes
      his "chicken," as the phrase is. The United States sloop "Water Witch" had
      recently been captured in Ossabaw Sound, and her crew brought into prison.
      One of her boys&mdash;a bright, handsome little fellow of about fifteen&mdash;had
      lost one of his arms in the fight. He was brought into the Hospital, and
      the old fellow whose "chicken" he was, was allowed to accompany and nurse
      him. This "old barnacle-back" was as surly a growler as ever went aloft,
      but to his "chicken" he was as tender and thoughtful as a woman. They
      found a shady nook in one corner, and any moment one looked in that
      direction he could see the old tar hard at work at something for the
      comfort and pleasure of his pet. Now he was dressing the wound as deftly
      and gently as a mother caring for a new-born babe; now he was trying to
      concoct some relish out of the slender materials he could beg or steal
      from the Quartermaster; now trying to arrange the shade of the bed of pine
      leaves in a more comfortable manner; now repairing or washing his clothes,
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the sailors were particularly favored by being allowed to bring their
      bags in untouched by the guards. This "chicken" had a wonderful supply of
      clothes, the handiwork of his protector who, like most good sailors, was
      very skillful with the needle. He had suits of fine white duck,
      embroidered with blue in a way that would ravish the heart of a fine lady,
      and blue suits similarly embroidered with white. No belle ever kept her
      clothes in better order than these were. When the duck came up from the
      old sailor's patient washing it was as spotless as new-fallen snow. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      I found my chum in a very bad condition. His appetite was entirely gone,
      but he had an inordinate craving for tobacco&mdash;for strong, black plug
      &mdash;which he smoked in a pipe. He had already traded off all his brass
      buttons to the guards for this. I had accumulated a few buttons to bribe
      the guard to take me out for wood, and I gave these also for tobacco for
      him. When I awoke one morning the man who laid next to me on the right was
      dead, having died sometime during the night. I searched his pockets and
      took what was in them. These were a silk pocket handkerchief, a gutta
      percha finger-ring, a comb, a pencil, and a leather pocket-book, making in
      all quite a nice little "find." I hied over to the guard, and succeeded in
      trading the personal estate which I had inherited from the intestate
      deceased, for a handful of peaches, a handful of hardly ripe figs, and a
      long plug of tobacco. I hastened back to Watts, expecting that the figs
      and peaches would do him a world of good. At first I did not show him the
      tobacco, as I was strongly opposed to his using it, thinking that it was
      making him much worse. But he looked at the tempting peaches and figs with
      lack-luster eyes; he was too far gone to care for them. He pushed them
      back to me, saying faintly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you take 'em, Mc; I don't want 'em; I can't eat 'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I then produced the tobacco, and his face lighted up. Concluding that this
      was all the comfort that he could have, and that I might as well gratify
      him, I cut up some of the weed, filled his pipe and lighted it. He smoked
      calmly and almost happily all the afternoon, hardly speaking a word to me.
      As it grew dark he asked me to bring him a drink. I did so, and as I
      raised him up he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mc, this thing's ended. Tell my father that I stood it as long as I
      could, and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The death rattle sounded in his throat, and when I laid him back it was
      all over. Straightening out his limbs, folding his hands across his
      breast, and composing his features as best I could, I lay, down beside the
      body and slept till morning, when I did what little else I could toward
      preparing for the grave all that was left of my long-suffering little
      friend. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp363" id="linkp363"></a>

    <p>
      DETERMINATION TO ESCAPE&mdash;DIFFERENT PLANS AND THEIR MERITS&mdash;I
      PREFER THE APPALACHICOLA ROUTE&mdash;PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE&mdash;A
      HOT DAY&mdash;THE FENCE PASSED SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED BY THE HOUNDS&mdash;CAUGHT
      &mdash;RETURNED TO THE STOCKADE.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Watt's death, I set earnestly about seeing what could be done in the
      way of escape. Frank Harvey, of the First West Virginia Cavalry, a boy of
      about my own age and disposition, joined with me in the scheme. I was
      still possessed with my original plan of making my way down the creeks to
      the Flint River, down the Flint River to where it emptied into the
      Appalachicola River, and down that stream to its debauchure into the bay
      that connected with the Gulf of Mexico. I was sure of finding my way by
      this route, because, if nothing else offered, I could get astride of a log
      and float down the current. The way to Sherman, in the other direction,
      was long, torturous and difficult, with a fearful gauntlet of
      blood-hounds, patrols and the scouts of Hood's Army to be run. I had but
      little difficulty in persuading Harvey into an acceptance of my views, and
      we began arranging for a solution of the first great problem&mdash;how to
      get outside of the Hospital guards. As I have explained before, the
      Hospital was surrounded by a board fence, with guards walking their beats
      on the ground outside. A small creek flowed through the southern end of
      the grounds, and at its lower end was used as a sink. The boards of the
      fence came down to the surface of the water, where the Creek passed out,
      but we found, by careful prodding with a stick, that the hole between the
      boards and the bottom of the Creek was sufficiently large to allow the
      passage of our bodies, and there had been no stakes driven or other
      precautions used to prevent egress by this channel. A guard was posted
      there, and probably ordered to stand at the edge of the stream, but it
      smelled so vilely in those scorching days that he had consulted his
      feelings and probably his health, by retiring to the top of the bank, a
      rod or more distant. We watched night after night, and at last were
      gratified to find that none went nearer the Creak than the top of this
      bank. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp365" id="linkp365"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p365.jpg (40K)" src="images/p365.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we waited for the moon to come right, so that the first part of the
      night should be dark. This took several days, but at last we knew that the
      next night she would not rise until between 9 and 10 o'clock, which would
      give us nearly two hours of the dense darkness of a moonless Summer night
      in the South. We had first thought of saving up some rations for the trip,
      but then reflected that these would be ruined by the filthy water into
      which we must sink to go under the fence. It was not difficult to abandon
      the food idea, since it was very hard to force ourselves to lay by even
      the smallest portion of our scanty rations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the next day wore on, our minds were wrought up into exalted tension by
      the rapid approach of the supreme moment, with all its chances and
      consequences. The experience of the past few months was not such as to
      mentally fit us for such a hazard. It prepared us for sullen,
      uncomplaining endurance, for calmly contemplating the worst that could
      come; but it did not strengthen that fiber of mind that leads to
      venturesome activity and daring exploits. Doubtless the weakness of our
      bodies reacted upon our spirits. We contemplated all the perils that
      confronted us; perils that, now looming up with impending nearness, took a
      clearer and more threatening shape than they had ever done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      We considered the desperate chances of passing the guard unseen; or, if
      noticed, of escaping his fire without death or severe wounds. But
      supposing him fortunately evaded, then came the gauntlet of the hounds and
      the patrols hunting deserters. After this, a long, weary journey, with
      bare feet and almost naked bodies, through an unknown country abounding
      with enemies; the dangers of assassination by the embittered populace; the
      risks of dying with hunger and fatigue in the gloomy depths of a swamp;
      the scanty hopes that, if we reached the seashore, we could get to our
      vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of all these contingencies failed to expand itself to all its
      alarming proportions, and unite with its fellows to form a dreadful vista,
      like the valleys filled with demons and genii, dragons and malign
      enchantments, which confront the heros of the "Arabian Nights," when they
      set out to perform their exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      But behind us lay more miseries and horrors than a riotous imagination
      could conceive; before us could certainly be nothing worse. We would put
      life and freedom to the hazard of a touch, and win or lose it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been intolerably hot. The sun's rays seemed to sear the earth,
      like heated irons, and the air that lay on the burning sand was broken by
      wavy lines, such as one sees indicate the radiation from a hot stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except the wretched chain-gang plodding torturously back and forward on
      the hillside, not a soul nor an animal could be seen in motion outside the
      Stockade. The hounds were panting in their kennel; the Rebel officers,
      half or wholly drunken with villainous sorgum whisky, were stretched at
      full length in the shade at headquarters; the half-caked gunners crouched
      under the shadow of the embankments of the forts, the guards hung limply
      over the Stockade in front of their little perches; the thirty thousand
      boys inside the Stockade, prone or supine upon the glowing sand, gasped
      for breath&mdash;for one draft of sweet, cool, wholesome air that did not
      bear on its wings the subtle seeds of rank corruption and death.
      Everywhere was the prostration of discomfort&mdash;the inertia of
      sluggishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the sick moved; only the pain-racked cried out; only the dying
      struggled; only the agonies of dissolution could make life assert itself
      against the exhaustion of the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey and I, lying in the scanty shade of the trunk of a tall pine, and
      with hearts filled with solicitude as to the outcome of what the evening
      would bring us, looked out over the scene as we had done daily for long
      months, and remained silent for hours, until the sun, as if weary with
      torturing and slaying, began going down in the blazing West. The groans of
      the thousands of sick around us, the shrieks of the rotting ones in the
      gangrene wards rang incessantly in our ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun disappeared, and the heat abated, the suspended activity was
      restored. The Master of the Hounds came out with his yelping pack, and
      started on his rounds; the Rebel officers aroused themselves from their
      siesta and went lazily about their duties; the fifer produced his cracked
      fife and piped forth his unvarying "Bonnie Blue Flag," as a signal for
      dress parade, and drums beaten by unskilled hands in the camps of the
      different regiments, repeated the signal. In time Stockade the mass of
      humanity became full of motion as an ant hill, and resembled it very much
      from our point of view, with the boys threading their way among the
      burrows, tents and holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was becoming dark quite rapidly. The moments seemed galloping onward
      toward the time when we must make the decisive step. We drew from the
      dirty rag in which it was wrapped the little piece of corn bread that we
      had saved for our supper, carefully divided it into two equal parts, and
      each took one and ate it in silence. This done, we held a final
      consultation as to our plans, and went over each detail carefully, that we
      might fully understand each other under all possible circumstances, and
      act in concert. One point we laboriously impressed upon each other, and
      that was; that under no circumstances were we to allow ourselves to be
      tempted to leave the Creek until we reached its junction with the Flint
      River. I then picked up two pine leaves, broke them off to unequal
      lengths, rolled them in my hands behind my back for a second, and
      presenting them to Harney with their ends sticking out of my closed hand,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one that gets the longest one goes first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey reached forth and drew the longer one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made a tour of reconnaissance. Everything seemed as usual, and
      wonderfully calm compared with the tumult in our minds. The Hospital
      guards were pacing their beats lazily; those on the Stockade were drawling
      listlessly the first "call around" of the evening:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Post numbah foah! Half-past seven o'clock! and a-l-l's we-l-ll!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the Stockade was a Babel of sounds, above all of which rose the
      melody of religious and patriotic songs, sung in various parts of the
      camp. From the headquarters came the shouts and laughter of the Rebel
      officers having a little "frolic" in the cool of the evening. The groans
      of the sick around us were gradually hushing, as the abatement of the
      terrible heat let all but the worst cases sink into a brief slumber, from
      which they awoke before midnight to renew their outcries. But those in the
      Gangrene wards seemed to be denied even this scanty blessing. Apparently
      they never slept, for their shrieks never ceased. A multitude of
      whip-poor-wills in the woods around us began their usual dismal cry, which
      had never seemed so unearthly and full of dreadful presages as now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, now quite dark, and we stole noiselessly down to the Creek and
      reconnoitered. We listened. The guard was not pacing his beat, as we could
      not hear his footsteps. A large, ill-shapen lump against the trunk of one
      of the trees on the bank showed that he was leaning there resting himself.
      We watched him for several minutes, but he did not move, and the thought
      shot into our minds that he might be asleep; but it seemed impossible: it
      was too early in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if ever, was the opportunity. Harney squeezed my hand, stepped
      noiselessly into the Creek, laid himself gently down into the filthy
      water, and while my heart was beating so that I was certain it could be
      heard some distance from me, began making toward the fence. He passed
      under easily, and I raised my eyes toward the guard, while on my strained
      ear fell the soft plashing made by Harvey as he pulled himself cautiously
      forward. It seemed as if the sentinel must hear this; he could not help
      it, and every second I expected to see the black lump address itself to
      motion, and the musket flash out fiendishly. But he did not; the lump
      remained motionless; the musket silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I thought that Harvey had gained a sufficient distance I followed. It
      seemed as if the disgusting water would smother me as I laid myself down
      into it, and such was my agitation that it appeared almost impossible that
      I should escape making such a noise as would attract the guard's notice.
      Catching hold of the roots and limbs at the side of the stream, I pulled
      myself slowly along, and as noiselessly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed under the fence without difficulty, and was outside, and within
      fifteen feet of the guard. I had lain down into the creek upon my right
      side, that my face might be toward the guard, and I could watch him
      closely all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I came under the fence he was still leaning motionless against the
      tree, but to my heated imagination he appeared to have turned and be
      watching me. I hardly breathed; the filthy water rippling past me seemed
      to roar to attract the guard's attention; I reached my hand out cautiously
      to grasp a root to pull myself along by, and caught instead a dry branch,
      which broke with a loud crack. My heart absolutely stood still. The guard
      evidently heard the noise. The black lump separated itself from the tree,
      and a straight line which I knew to be his musket separated itself from
      the lump. In a brief instant I lived a year of mortal apprehension. So
      certain was I that he had discovered me, and was leveling his piece to
      fire, that I could scarcely restrain myself from springing up and dashing
      away to avoid the shot. Then I heard him take a step, and to my
      unutterable surprise and relief, he walked off farther from the Creek,
      evidently to speak to the man whose beat joined his.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled away more swiftly, but still with the greatest caution, until
      after half-an-hour's painful effort I had gotten fully one hundred and
      fifty yards away from the Hospital fence, and found Harney crouched on a
      cypress knee, close to the water's edge, watching for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We waited there a few minutes, until I could rest, and calm my perturbed
      nerves down to something nearer their normal equilibrium, and then started
      on. We hoped that if we were as lucky in our next step as in the first one
      we would reach the Flint River by daylight, and have a good long start
      before the morning roll-call revealed our absence. We could hear the
      hounds still baying in the distance, but this sound was too customary to
      give us any uneasiness. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp370"
      id="linkp370"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But our progress was terribly slow. Every step hurt fearfully. The Creek
      bed was full of roots and snags, and briers, and vines trailed across it.
      These caught and tore our bare feet and legs, rendered abnormally tender
      by the scurvy. It seemed as if every step was marked with blood. The vines
      tripped us, and we frequently fell headlong. We struggled on determinedly
      for nearly an hour, and were perhaps a mile from the Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon came up, and its light showed that the creek continued its course
      through a dense jungle like that we had been traversing, while on the high
      ground to our left were the open pine woods I have previously described.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stopped and debated for a few minutes. We recalled our promise to keep
      in the Creek, the experience of other boys who had tried to escape and
      been caught by the hounds. If we staid in the Creek we were sure the
      hounds would not find our trail, but it was equally certain that at this
      rate we would be exhausted and starved before we got out of sight of the
      prison. It seemed that we had gone far enough to be out of reach of the
      packs patrolling immediately around the Stockade, and there could be but
      little risk in trying a short walk on the dry ground. We concluded to take
      the chances, and, ascending the bank, we walked and ran as fast as we
      could for about two miles further.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once it struck me that with all our progress the hounds sounded as
      near as when we started. I shivered at the thought, and though nearly
      ready to drop with fatigue, urged myself and Harney on.

    <p>
      An instant later their baying rang out on the still night air right behind
      us, and with fearful distinctness. There was no mistake now; they had
      found our trail, and were running us down. The change from fearful
      apprehension to the crushing reality stopped us stock-still in our tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next breath the hounds came bursting through the woods in plain
      sight, and in full cry. We obeyed our first impulse; rushed back into the
      swamp, forced our way for a few yards through the flesh-tearing
      impediments, until we gained a large cypress, upon whose great knees we
      climbed&mdash;thoroughly exhausted&mdash;just as the yelping pack reached
      the edge of the water, and stopped there and bayed at us. It was a
      physical impossibility for us to go another step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the low-browed villain who had charge of the hounds came
      galloping up on his mule, tooting signals to his dogs as he came, on the
      cow-horn slung from his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He immediately discovered us, covered us with his revolver, and yelled
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come ashore, there, quick: you&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
      &mdash;&mdash;s!" <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp372" id="linkp372"></a>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. We climbed down off the knees and started
      towards the land. As we neared it, the hounds became almost frantic, and
      it seemed as if we would be torn to pieces the moment they could reach us.
      But the master dismounted and drove them back. He was surly &mdash;even
      savage&mdash;to us, but seemed in too much hurry to get back to waste any
      time annoying us with the dogs. He ordered us to get around in front of
      the mule, and start back to camp. We moved as rapidly as our fatigue and
      our lacerated feet would allow us, and before midnight were again in the
      hospital, fatigued, filthy, torn, bruised and wretched beyond description
      or conception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning we were turned back into the Stockade as punishment.

      AUGUST&mdash;GOOD LUCK IN NOT MEETING CAPTAIN WIRZ&mdash;THAT WORTHY'S
      TREATMENT OF RECAPTURED PRISONERS&mdash;SECRET SOCIETIES IN PRISON&mdash;SINGULAR
      MEETING AND ITS RESULT&mdash;DISCOVERY AND REMOVAL OF THE OFFICERS AMONG
      THE ENLISTED MEN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harney and I were specially fortunate in being turned back into the
      Stockade without being brought before Captain Wirz.
    </p>
    <p>
      We subsequently learned that we owed this good luck to Wirz's absence on
      sick leave&mdash;his place being supplied by Lieutenant Davis, a moderate
      brained Baltimorean, and one of that horde of Marylanders in the Rebel
      Army, whose principal service to the Confederacy consisted in working
      themselves into "bomb-proof" places, and forcing those whom they displaced
      into the field. Winder was the illustrious head of this crowd of
      bomb-proof Rebels from "Maryland, My Maryland!" whose enthusiasm for the
      Southern cause and consistency in serving it only in such places as were
      out of range of the Yankee artillery, was the subject of many bitter jibes
      by the Rebels&mdash;especially by those whose secure berths they possessed
      themselves of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Davis went into the war with great brashness. He was one of the
      mob which attacked the Sixth Massachusetts in its passage through
      Baltimore, but, like all of that class of roughs, he got his stomach full
      of war as soon as the real business of fighting began, and he retired to
      where the chances of attaining a ripe old age were better than in front of
      the Army of the Potomac's muskets. We shall hear of Davis again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encountering Captain Wirz was one of the terrors of an abortive attempt to
      escape. When recaptured prisoners were brought before him he would
      frequently give way to paroxysms of screaming rage, so violent as to
      closely verge on insanity. Brandishing the fearful and wonderful revolver&mdash;of
      which I have spoken in such a manner as to threaten the luckless captives
      with instant death, he would shriek out imprecations, curses; and foul
      epithets in French, German and English, until he fairly frothed at the
      mouth. There were plenty of stories current in camp of his having several
      times given away to his rage so far as to actually shoot men down in these
      interviews, and still more of his knocking boys down and jumping upon
      them, until he inflicted injuries that soon resulted in death. How true
      these rumors were I am unable to say of my own personal knowledge, since I
      never saw him kill any one, nor have I talked with any one who did. There
      were a number of cases of this kind testified to upon his trial, but they
      all happened among "paroles" outside the Stockade, or among the prisoners
      inside after we left, so I knew nothing of them. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a
      name="linkp375" id="linkp375"></a>

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the Old Switzer's favorite ways of ending these seances was to
      inform the boys that he would have them shot in an hour or so, and bid
      them prepare for death. After keeping them in fearful suspense for hours
      he would order them to be punished with the stocks, the ball-and-chain,
      the chain-gang, or&mdash;if his fierce mood had burned itself entirely out
      &mdash;as was quite likely with a man of his shallop' brain and
      vacillating temper&mdash;to be simply returned to the stockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, I am sure, since the days of the Inquisition&mdash;or still
      later, since the terrible punishments visited upon the insurgents of 1848
      by the Austrian aristocrats&mdash;has been so diabolical as the stocks and
      chain-gangs, as used by Wirz. At one time seven men, sitting in the stocks
      near the Star Fort&mdash;in plain view of the camp&mdash;became objects of
      interest to everybody inside. They were never relieved from their painful
      position, but were kept there until all of them died. I think it was
      nearly two weeks before the last one succumbed. What they endured in that
      time even imagination cannot conceive&mdash;I do not think that an Indian
      tribe ever devised keener torture for its captives. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <a name="linkp376" id="linkp376"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The chain-gang consisted of a number of men&mdash;varying from twelve to
      twenty-five, all chained to one sixty-four pound ball. They were also
      stationed near the Star Fort, standing out in the hot sun, without a
      particle of shade over them. When one moved they all had to move. They
      were scourged with the dysentery, and the necessities of some one of their
      number kept them constantly in motion. I can see them distinctly yet,
      tramping laboriously and painfully back and forward over that burning
      hillside, every moment of the long, weary Summer days.
    </p>
    <p>
      A comrade writes to remind me of the beneficent work of the Masonic Order.
      I mention it most gladly, as it was the sole recognition on the part of
      any of our foes of our claims to human kinship. The churches of all
      denominations&mdash;except the solitary Catholic priest, Father Hamilton,
      &mdash;ignored us as wholly as if we were dumb beasts. Lay humanitarians
      were equally indifferent, and the only interest manifested by any Rebel in
      the welfare of any prisoner was by the Masonic brotherhood. The Rebel
      Masons interested themselves in securing details outside the Stockade in
      the cookhouse, the commissary, and elsewhere, for the brethren among the
      prisoners who would accept such favors. Such as did not feel inclined to
      go outside on parole received frequent presents in the way of food, and
      especially of vegetables, which were literally beyond price. Materials
      were sent inside to build tents for the Masons, and I think such as made
      themselves known before death, received burial according to the rites of
      the Order. Doctor White, and perhaps other Surgeons, belonged to the
      fraternity, and the wearing of a Masonic emblem by a new prisoner was
      pretty sure to catch their eyes, and be the means of securing for the
      wearer the tender of their good offices, such as a detail into the
      Hospital as nurse, ward-master, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not fortunate enough to be one of the mystic brethren, and so missed
      all share in any of these benefits, as well as in any others, and I take
      special pride in one thing: that during my whole imprisonment I was not
      beholden to a Rebel for a single favor of any kind. The Rebel does not
      live who can say that he ever gave me so much as a handful of meal, a
      spoonful of salt, an inch of thread, or a stick of wood. From first to
      last I received nothing but my rations, except occasional trifles that I
      succeeded in stealing from the stupid officers charged with issuing
      rations. I owe no man in the Southern Confederacy gratitude for anything&mdash;not
      even for a kind word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of secret society pins recalls a noteworthy story which has been
      told me since the war, of boys whom I knew. At the breaking out of
      hostilities there existed in Toledo a festive little secret society, such
      as lurking boys frequently organize, with no other object than fun and the
      usual adolescent love of mystery. There were a dozen or so members in it
      who called themselves "The Royal Reubens," and were headed by a bookbinder
      named Ned Hopkins. Some one started a branch of the Order in Napoleon, O.,
      and among the members was Charles E. Reynolds, of that town. The badge of
      the society was a peculiarly shaped gold pin. Reynolds and Hopkins never
      met, and had no acquaintance with each other. When the war broke out,
      Hopkins enlisted in Battery H, First Ohio Artillery, and was sent to the
      Army of the Potomac, where he was captured, in the Fall of 1863, while
      scouting, in the neighborhood of Richmond. Reynolds entered the
      Sixty-Eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and was taken in the neighborhood of
      Jackson, Miss.,&mdash;two thousand miles from the place of Hopkins's
      capture. At Andersonville Hopkins became one of the officers in charge of
      the Hospital. One day a Rebel Sergeant, who called the roll in the
      Stockade, after studying Hopkins's pin a minute, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seed a Yank in the Stockade to-day a-wearing a pin egzackly like that
      ere."
    </p>
    <p>
      This aroused Hopkins's interest, and he went inside in search of the other
      "feller." Having his squad and detachment there was little difficulty in
      finding him. He recognized the pin, spoke to its wearer, gave him the
      "grand hailing sign" of the "Royal Reubens," and it was duly responded to.
      The upshot of the matter was that he took Reynolds out with him as clerk,
      and saved his life, as the latter was going down hill very rapidly.
      Reynolds, in turn, secured the detail of a comrade of the Sixty-Eighth who
      was failing fast, and succeeded in saving his life&mdash;all of which
      happy results were directly attributable to that insignificant boyish
      society, and its equally unimportant badge of membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along in the last of August the Rebels learned that there were between two
      and three hundred Captains and Lieutenants in the Stockade, passing
      themselves off as enlisted men. The motive of these officers was two-fold:
      first, a chivalrous wish to share the fortunes and fate of their boys, and
      second, disinclination to gratify the Rebels by the knowledge of the rank
      of their captives. The secret was so well kept that none of us suspected
      it until the fact was announced by the Rebels themselves. They were taken
      out immediately, and sent to Macon, where the commissioned officers'
      prison was. It would not do to trust such possible leaders with us another
      day. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      FOOD&mdash;THE MEAGERNESS, INFERIOR QUALITY, AND TERRIBLE SAMENESS &mdash;REBEL
      TESTIMONY ON THE SUBJECT&mdash;FUTILITY OF SUCCESSFUL EXPLANATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have in other places dwelt upon the insufficiency and the nauseousness
      of the food. No words that I can use, no insistence upon this theme, can
      give the reader any idea of its mortal importance to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the reader consider for a moment the quantity, quality, and variety of
      food that he now holds to be necessary for the maintenance of life and
      health. I trust that every one who peruses this book&mdash;that every one
      in fact over whom the Stars and Stripes wave&mdash;has his cup of coffee,
      his biscuits and his beefsteak for breakfast&mdash;a substantial dinner of
      roast or boiled&mdash;and a lighter, but still sufficient meal in the
      evening. In all, certainly not less than fifty different articles are set
      before him during the day, for his choice as elements of nourishment. Let
      him scan this extended bill-of-fare, which long custom has made so
      common-place as to be uninteresting&mdash;perhaps even wearisome to think
      about &mdash;and see what he could omit from it, if necessity compelled
      him. After a reluctant farewell to fish, butter, eggs, milk, sugar, green
      and preserved fruits, etc., he thinks that perhaps under extraordinary
      circumstances he might be able to merely sustain life for a limited period
      on a diet of bread and meat three times a day, washed down with creamless,
      unsweetened coffee, and varied occasionally with additions of potatos,
      onions, beans, etc. It would astonish the Innocent to have one of our
      veterans inform him that this was not even the first stage of destitution;
      that a soldier who had these was expected to be on the summit level of
      contentment. Any of the boys who followed Grant to Appomattox Court House,
      Sherman to the Sea, or "Pap" Thomas till his glorious career culminated
      with the annihilation of Hood, will tell him of many weeks when a slice of
      fat pork on a piece of "hard tack" had to do duty for the breakfast of
      beefsteak and biscuits; when another slice of fat pork and another cracker
      served for the dinner of roast beef and vegetables, and a third cracker
      and slice of pork was a substitute for the supper of toast and chops.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say to these veterans in turn that they did not arrive at the first
      stages of destitution compared with the depths to which we were dragged.
      The restriction for a few weeks to a diet of crackers and fat pork was
      certainly a hardship, but the crackers alone, chemists tell us, contain
      all the elements necessary to support life, and in our Army they were
      always well made and very palatable. I believe I risk nothing in saying
      that one of the ordinary square crackers of our Commissary Department
      contained much more real nutriment than the whole of our average ration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have before compared the size, shape and appearance of the daily half
      loaf of corn bread issued to us to a half-brick, and I do not yet know of
      a more fitting comparison. At first we got a small piece of rusty bacon
      along with this; but the size of this diminished steadily until at last it
      faded away entirely, and during the last six months of our imprisonment I
      do not believe that we received rations of meat above a half-dozen times.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this smallness was added ineffable badness. The meal was ground very
      coarsely, by dull, weakly propelled stones, that imperfectly crushed the
      grains, and left the tough, hard coating of the kernels in large, sharp,
      mica-like scales, which cut and inflamed the stomach and intestines, like
      handfuls of pounded glass. The alimentary canals of all compelled to eat
      it were kept in a continual state of irritation that usually terminated in
      incurable dysentery.
    </p>
    <p>
      That I have not over-stated this evil can be seen by reference to the
      testimony of so competent a scientific observer as Professor Jones, and I
      add to that unimpeachable testimony the following extract from the
      statement made in an attempted defense of Andersonville by Doctor R.
      Randolph Stevenson, who styles himself, formerly Surgeon in the Army of
      the Confederate States of America, Chief Surgeon of the Confederate States
      Military Prison Hospitals, Andersonville, Ga.:
    </p>
    <p>
      V. From the sameness of the food, and from the action of the poisonous
      gases in the densely crowded and filthy Stockade and Hospital, the blood
      was altered in its constitution, even, before the manifestation of actual
      disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both the well and the sick, the red corpuscles were diminished; and in
      all diseases uncomplicated with inflammation, the fibrinous element was
      deficient. In cases of ulceration of the mucous membrane of the intestinal
      canal, the fibrinous element of the blood appeared to be increased; while
      in simple diarrhea, uncomplicated with ulceration, and dependent upon the
      character of the food and the existence of scurvy, it was either
      diminished or remained stationary. Heart-clots were very common, if not
      universally present, in the cases of ulceration of the intestinal mucous
      membrane; while in the uncomplicated cases of diarrhea and scurvy, the
      blood was fluid and did not coagulate readily, and the heart-clots and
      fibrinous concretions were almost universally absent. From the watery
      condition of the blood there resulted various serous effusions into the
      pericardium, into the ventricles of the brain, and into the abdominal
      cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In almost all cases which I examined after death, even in the most
      emaciated, there was more or less serous effusion into the abdominal
      cavity. In cases of hospital gangrene of the extremities, and in cases of
      gangrene of the intestines, heart-clots and firm coagula were universally
      present. The presence of these clots in the cases of hospital gangrene,
      whilst they were absent in the cases in which there were no inflammatory
      symptoms, appears to sustain the conclusion that hospital gangrene is a
      species of inflammation (imperfect and irregular though it may be in its
      progress), in which the fibrinous element and coagulability of the blood
      are increased, even in those who are suffering from such a condition of
      the blood and from such diseases as are naturally accompanied with a
      decrease in the fibrinous constituent.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. The impoverished condition of the blood, which led to serous effusions
      within the ventricles of the brain, and around the brain and spinal cord,
      and into the pericardial and abdominal cavities, was gradually induced by
      the action of several causes, but chiefly by the character of the food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Federal prisoners, as a general rule, had been reared upon wheat bread
      and Irish potatos; and the Indian corn so extensively used at the South,
      was almost unknown to them as an article of diet previous to their
      capture. Owing to the impossibility of obtaining the necessary sieves in
      the Confederacy for the separation of the husk from the corn-meal, the
      rations of the Confederate soldiers, as well as of the Federal prisoners,
      consisted of unbolted corn-flour, and meal and grist; this circumstance
      rendered the corn-bread still more disagreeable and distasteful to the
      Federal prisoners. While Indian meal, even when prepared with the husk, is
      one of the most wholesome and nutritious forms of food, as has been
      already shown by the health and rapid increase of the Southern population,
      and especially of the negros, previous to the present war, and by the
      strength, endurance and activity of the Confederate soldiers, who were
      throughout the war confined to a great extent to unbolted corn-meal; it is
      nevertheless true that those who have not been reared upon corn-meal, or
      who have not accustomed themselves to its use gradually, become
      excessively tired of this kind of diet when suddenly confined to it
      without a due proportion of wheat bread. Large numbers of the Federal
      prisoners appeared to be utterly disgusted with Indian corn, and immense
      piles of corn-bread could be seen in the Stockade and Hospital inclosures.
      Those who were so disgusted with this form of food that they had no
      appetite to partake of it, except in quantities insufficient to supply the
      waste of the tissues, were, of course, in the condition of men slowly
      starving, notwithstanding that the only farinaceous form of food which the
      Confederate States produced in sufficient abundance for the maintenance of
      armies was not withheld from them. In such cases, an urgent feeling of
      hunger was not a prominent symptom; and even when it existed at first, it
      soon disappeared, and was succeeded by an actual loathing of food. In this
      state the muscular strength was rapidly diminished, the tissues wasted,
      and the thin, skeleton-like forms moved about with the appearance of utter
      exhaustion and dejection. The mental condition connected with long
      confinement, with the most miserable surroundings, and with no hope for
      the future, also depressed all the nervous and vital actions, and was
      especially active in destroying the appetite. The effects of mental
      depression, and of defective nutrition, were manifested not only in the
      slow, feeble motions of the wasted, skeleton-like forms, but also in such
      lethargy, listlessness, and torpor of the mental faculties as rendered
      these unfortunate men oblivious and indifferent to their afflicted
      condition. In many cases, even of the greatest apparent suffering and
      distress, instead of showing any anxiety to communicate the causes of
      their distress, or to relate their privations, and their longings for
      their homes and their friends and relatives, they lay in a listless,
      lethargic, uncomplaining state, taking no notice either of their own
      distressed condition, or of the gigantic mass of human misery by which
      they were surrounded. Nothing appalled and depressed me so much as this
      silent, uncomplaining misery. It is a fact of great interest, that
      notwithstanding this defective nutrition in men subjected to crowding and
      filth, contagious fevers were rare; and typhus fever, which is supposed to
      be generated in just such a state of things as existed at Andersonville,
      was unknown. These facts, established by my investigations, stand in
      striking contrast with such a statement as the following by a recent
      English writer:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A deficiency of food, especially of the nitrogenous part, quickly leads
      to the breaking up of the animal frame. Plague, pestilence and famine are
      associated with each other in the public mind, and the records of every
      country show how closely they are related. The medical history of Ireland
      is remarkable for the illustrations of how much mischief may be occasioned
      by a general deficiency of food. Always the habitat of fever, it every now
      and then becomes the very hot-bed of its propagation and development. Let
      there be but a small failure in the usual imperfect supply of food, and
      the lurking seeds of pestilence are ready to burst into frightful
      activity. The famine of the present century is but too forcible and
      illustrative of this. It fostered epidemics which have not been witnessed
      in this generation, and gave rise to scenes of devastation and misery
      which are not surpassed by the most appalling epidemics of the Middle
      Ages. The principal form of the scourge was known as the contagious famine
      fever (typhus), and it spread, not merely from end to end of the country
      in which it had originated, but, breaking through all boundaries, it
      crossed the broad ocean, and made itself painfully manifest in localities
      where it was previously unknown. Thousands fell under the virulence of its
      action, for wherever it came it struck down a seventh of the people, and
      of those whom it attacked, one out of nine perished. Even those who
      escaped the fatal influence of it, were left the miserable victims of
      scurvy and low fever."
    </p>
    <p>
      While we readily admit that famine induces that state of the system which
      is the most susceptible to the action of fever poisons, and thus induces
      the state of the entire population which is most favorable for the rapid
      and destructive spread of all contagious fevers, at the same time we are
      forced by the facts established by the present war, as well as by a host
      of others, both old and new, to admit that we are still ignorant of the
      causes necessary for the origin of typhus fever. Added to the imperfect
      nature of the rations issued to the Federal prisoners, the difficulties of
      their situation were at times greatly increased by the sudden and
      desolating Federal raids in Virginia, Georgia, and other States, which
      necessitated the sudden transportation from Richmond and other points
      threatened of large bodies of prisoners, without the possibility of much
      previous preparation; and not only did these men suffer in transition upon
      the dilapidated and overburdened line of railroad communication, but after
      arriving at Andersonville, the rations were frequently insufficient to
      supply the sudden addition of several thousand men. And as the Confederacy
      became more and more pressed, and when powerful hostile armies were
      plunging through her bosom, the Federal prisoners of Andersonville
      suffered incredibly during the hasty removal to Millen, Savannah,
      Charleston, and other points, supposed at the time to be secure from the
      enemy. Each one of these causes must be weighed when an attempt is made to
      estimate the unusual mortality among these prisoners of war. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      VII. Scurvy, arising from sameness of food and imperfect nutrition,
      caused, either directly or indirectly, nine-tenths of the deaths among the
      Federal prisoners at Andersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only were the deaths referred to unknown causes, to apoplexy, to
      anasarca, and to debility, traceable to scurvy and its effects; and not
      only was the mortality in small-pox, pneumonia, and typhoid fever, and in
      all acute diseases, more than doubled by the scorbutic taint, but even
      those all but universal and deadly bowel affections arose from the same
      causes, and derived their fatal character from the same conditions which
      produced the scurvy. In truth, these men at Andersonville were in the
      condition of a crew at sea, confined in a foul ship upon salt meat and
      unvarying food, and without fresh vegetables. Not only so, but these
      unfortunate prisoners were men forcibly confined and crowded upon a ship
      tossed about on a stormy ocean, without a rudder, without a compass,
      without a guiding-star, and without any apparent boundary or to their
      voyage; and they reflected in their steadily increasing miseries the
      distressed condition and waning fortunes of devastated and bleeding
      country, which was compelled, in justice to her own unfortunate sons, to
      hold these men in the most distressing captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw nothing in the scurvy which prevailed so universally at
      Andersonville, at all different from this disease as described by various
      standard writers. The mortality was no greater than that which has
      afflicted a hundred ships upon long voyages, and it did not exceed the
      mortality which has, upon me than one occasion, and in a much shorter
      period of time, annihilated large armies and desolated beleaguered cities.
      The general results of my investigations upon the chronic diarrhea and
      dysentery of the Federal prisoners of Andersonville were similar to those
      of the English surgeons during the war against Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      IX. Drugs exercised but little influence over the progress and fatal
      termination of chronic diarrhea and dysentery in the Military Prison and
      Hospital at Andersonville, chiefly because the proper form of nourishment
      (milk, rice, vegetables, anti-scorbutics, and nourishing animal and
      vegetable soups) was not issued, and could not be procured in sufficient
      quantities for the sick prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opium allayed pain and checked the bowels temporarily, but the frail dam
      was soon swept away, and the patient appears to be but little better, if
      not the worse, for this merely palliative treatment. The root of the
      difficulty could not be reached by drugs; nothing short of the wanting
      elements of nutrition would have tended in any manner to restore the tone
      of the digestive system, and of all the wasted and degenerated organs and
      tissues. My opinion to this effect was expressed most decidedly to the
      medical officers in charge of these unfortunate men. The correctness of
      this view was sustained by the healthy and robust condition of the paroled
      prisoners, who received an extra ration, and who were able to make
      considerable sums by trading, and who supplied themselves with a liberal
      and varied diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      X. The fact that hospital gangrene appeared in the Stockade first, and
      originated spontaneously, without any previous contagion, and occurred
      sporadically all over the Stockade and Prison Hospital, was proof positive
      that this disease will arise whenever the conditions of crowding, filth,
      foul air, and bad diet are present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exhalations from the Hospital and Stockade appeared to exert their
      effects to a considerable distance outside of these localities. The origin
      of gangrene among these prisoners appeared clearly to depend in great
      measure upon the state of the general system, induced by diet, exposure,
      neglect of personal cleanliness; and by various external noxious
      influences. The rapidity of the appearance and action of the gangrene
      depended upon the powers and state of the constitution, as well as upon
      the intensity of the poison in the atmosphere, or upon the direct
      application of poisonous matter to the wounded surface. This was further
      illustrated by the important fact, that hospital gangrene, or a disease
      resembling this form of gangrene, attacked the intestinal canal of
      patients laboring under ulceration of the bowels, although there were no
      local manifestations of gangrene upon the surface of the body. This mode
      of termination in cases of dysentery was quite common in the foul
      atmosphere of the Confederate States Military Prison Hospital; and in the
      depressed, depraved condition of the system of these Federal prisoners,
      death ensued very rapidly after the gangrenous state of the intestines was
      established. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp389" id="linkp389"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p389.jpg (43K)" src="images/p389.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      XI. A scorbutic condition of the system appeared to favor the origin of
      foul ulcers, which frequently took on true hospital gangrene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scurvy and gangrene frequently existed in the same individual. In such
      cases, vegetable diet with vegetable acids would remove the scorbutic
      condition without curing the hospital gangrene. . . Scurvy consists not
      only in an alteration in the constitution of the blood, which leads to
      passive hemorrhages from the bowels, and the effusion into the various
      tissues of a deeply-colored fibrinous exudation; but, as we have
      conclusively shown by postmortem examination, this state is attended with
      consistence of the muscles of the heart, and the mucous membrane of the
      alimentary canal, and of solid parts generally. We have, according to the
      extent of the deficiency of certain articles of food, every degree of
      scorbutic derangement, from the most fearful depravation of the blood and
      the perversion of every function subserved by the blood to those slight
      derangements which are scarcely distinguishable from a state of health. We
      are as yet ignorant of the true nature of the changes of the blood and
      tissues in scurvy, and wide field for investigation is open for the
      determination the characteristic changes&mdash;physical, chemical, and
      physiological&mdash;of the blood and tissues, and of the secretions and
      excretions of scurvy. Such inquiries would be of great value in their
      bearing upon the origin of hospital gangrene. Up to the present war, the
      results of chemical investigations upon the pathology of the blood in
      scurvy were not only contradictory, but meager, and wanting in that
      careful detail of the cases from which the blood was abstracted which
      would enable us to explain the cause of the apparent discrepancies in
      different analyses. Thus it is not yet settled whether the fibrin is
      increased or diminished in this disease; and the differences which exist
      in the statements of different writers appear to be referable to the
      neglect of a critical examination and record of all the symptoms of the
      cases from which the blood was abstracted. The true nature of the changes
      of the blood in scurvy can be established only by numerous analyses during
      different stages of the disease, and followed up by carefully performed
      and recorded postmortem examinations. With such data we could settle such
      important questions as whether the increase of fibrin in scurvy was
      invariably dependent upon some local inflammation.
    </p>
    <p>
      XII. Gangrenous spots, followed by rapid destruction of tissue, appeared
      in some cases in which there had been no previous or existing wound or
      abrasion; and without such well established facts, it might be assumed
      that the disease was propagated from one patient to another in every case,
      either by exhalations from the gangrenous surface or by direct contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a filthy and crowded hospital as that of the Confederate, States
      Military Prison of Camp Sumter, Andersonville, it was impossible to
      isolate the wounded from the sources of actual contact of the gangrenous
      matter. The flies swarming over the wounds and over filth of every
      description; the filthy, imperfectly washed, and scanty rags; the limited
      number of sponges and wash-bowls (the same wash-bowl and sponge serving
      for a score or more of patients), were one and all sources of such
      constant circulation of the gangrenous matter, that the disease might
      rapidly be propagated from a single gangrenous wound. While the fact
      already considered, that a form of moist gangrene, resembling hospital
      gangrene, was quite common in this foul atmosphere in cases of dysentery,
      both with and without the existence of hospital gangrene upon the surface,
      demonstrates the dependence of the disease upon the state of the
      constitution, and proves in a clear manner that neither the contact of the
      poisonous matter of gangrene, nor the direct action of the poisoned
      atmosphere upon the ulcerated surface, is necessary to the development of
      the disease; on the other hand, it is equally well-established that the
      disease may be communicated by the various ways just mentioned. It is
      impossible to determine the length of time which rags and clothing
      saturated with gangrenous matter will retain the power of reproducing the
      disease when applied to healthy wounds. Professor Brugmans, as quoted by
      Guthrie in his commentaries on the surgery of the war in Portugal, Spain,
      France, and the Netherlands, says that in 1797, in Holland, 'charpie,'
      composed of linen threads cut of different lengths, which, on inquiry, it
      was found had been already used in the great hospitals in France, and had
      been subsequently washed and bleached, caused every ulcer to which it was
      applied to be affected by hospital gangrene. Guthrie affirms in the same
      work, that the fact that this disease was readily communicated by the
      application of instruments, lint, or bandages which had been in contact
      with infected parts, was too firmly established by the experience of every
      one in Portugal and Spain to be a matter of doubt. There are facts to show
      that flies may be the means of communicating malignant pustules. Dr.
      Wagner, who has related several cases of malignant pustule produced in man
      and beasts, both by contact and by eating the flesh of diseased animals,
      which happened in the village of Striessa in Saxony, in 1834, gives two
      very remarkable cases which occurred eight days after any beast had been
      affected with the disease. Both were women, one of twenty-six and the
      other of fifty years, and in them the pustules were well marked, and the
      general symptoms similar to the other cases. The latter patient said she
      had been bitten by a fly upon the back d the neck, at which part the
      carbuncle appeared; and the former, that she had also been bitten upon the
      right upper arm by a gnat. Upon inquiry, Wagner found that the skin of one
      of the infected beasts had been hung on a neighboring wall, and thought it
      very possible that the insects might have been attracted to them by the
      smell, and had thence conveyed the poison. <br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      The old adage says that "Hunger is the best sauce for poor food," but
      hunger failed to render this detestable stuff palatable, and it became so
      loathsome that very many actually starved to death because unable to force
      their organs of deglutition to receive the nauseous dose and pass it to
      the stomach. I was always much healthier than the average of the boys, and
      my appetite consequently much better, yet for the last month that I was in
      Andersonville, it required all my determination to crowd the bread down my
      throat, and, as I have stated before, I could only do this by breaking off
      small bits at a time, and forcing each down as I would a pill.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large part of this repulsiveness was due to the coarseness and foulness
      of the meal, the wretched cooking, and the lack of salt, but there was a
      still more potent reason than all these. Nature does not intend that man
      shall live by bread alone, nor by any one kind of food. She indicates this
      by the varying tastes and longings that she gives him. If his body needs
      one kind of constituents, his tastes lead him to desire the food that is
      richest in those constituents. When he has taken as much as his system
      requires, the sense of satiety supervenes, and he "becomes tired" of that
      particular food. If tastes are not perverted, but allowed a free but
      temperate exercise, they are the surest indicators of the way to preserve
      health and strength by a judicious selection of alimentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case Nature was protesting by a rebellion of the tastes against
      any further use of that species of food. She was saying, as plainly as she
      ever spoke, that death could only be averted by a change of diet, which
      would supply our bodies with the constituents they so sadly needed, and
      which could not be supplied by corn meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      How needless was this confinement of our rations to corn meal, and
      especially to such wretchedly prepared meal, is conclusively shown by the
      Rebel testimony heretofore given. It would have been very little extra
      trouble to the Rebels to have had our meal sifted; we would gladly have
      done it ourselves if allowed the utensils and opportunity. It would have
      been as little trouble to have varied our rations with green corn and
      sweet potatos, of which the country was then full.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few wagon loads of roasting ears and sweet potatos would have banished
      every trace of scurvy from the camp, healed up the wasting dysentery, and
      saved thousands of lives. Any day that the Rebels had chosen they could
      have gotten a thousand volunteers who would have given their solemn parole
      not to escape, and gone any distance into the country, to gather the
      potatos and corn, and such other vegetables as were readily obtainable,
      and bring, them into the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever else may be said in defense of the Southern management of
      military prisons, the permitting seven thousand men to die of the scurvy
      in the Summer time, in the midst of an agricultural region, filled with
      all manner of green vegetation, must forever remain impossible of
      explanation. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      SOLICITUDE AS TO THE FATE OF ATLANTA AND SHERMAN'S ARMY&mdash;PAUCITY OF
      NEWS &mdash;HOW WE HEARD THAT ATLANTA HAD FALLEN&mdash;ANNOUNCEMENT OF A
      GENERAL EXCHANGE&mdash;WE LEAVE ANDERSONVILLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      We again began to be exceedingly solicitous over the fate of Atlanta and
      Sherman's Army: we had heard but little directly from that front for
      several weeks. Few prisoners had come in since those captured in the
      bloody engagements of the 20th, 22d, and 28th of July. In spite of their
      confident tones, and our own sanguine hopes, the outlook admitted of very
      grave doubts. The battles of the last week of July had been looked at it
      in the best light possible&mdash;indecisive. Our men had held their own,
      it is true, but an invading army can not afford to simply hold its own.
      Anything short of an absolute success is to it disguised defeat. Then we
      knew that the cavalry column sent out under Stoneman had been so badly
      handled by that inefficient commander that it had failed ridiculously in
      its object, being beaten in detail, and suffering the loss of its
      commander and a considerable portion of its numbers. This had been
      followed by a defeat of our infantry at Etowah Creek, and then came a long
      interval in which we received no news save what the Rebel papers
      contained, and they pretended no doubt that Sherman's failure was already
      demonstrated. Next came well-authenticated news that Sherman had raised
      the siege and fallen back to the Chattahoochee, and we felt something of
      the bitterness of despair. For days thereafter we heard nothing, though
      the hot, close Summer air seemed surcharged with the premonitions of a war
      storm about to burst, even as nature heralds in the same way a
      concentration of the mighty force of the elements for the grand crash of
      the thunderstorm. We waited in tense expectancy for the decision of the
      fates whether final victory or defeat should end the long and arduous
      campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night the guards in the perches around the Stockade called out every
      half hour, so as to show the officers that they were awake and attending
      to their duty. The formula for this ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Post numbah 1; half-past eight o'clock, and a-l-l 's w-e-l-l!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Post No. 2 repeated this cry, and so it went around.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when our anxiety as to Atlanta was wrought to the highest
      pitch, one of the guards sang out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Post numbah foah&mdash;half past eight o'clock&mdash;and Atlanta's&mdash;gone&mdash;t-o
      &mdash;hell." <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp395" id="linkp395"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p395.jpg (26K)" src="images/p395.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of every man within hearing leaped to his mouth. We looked
      toward each other, almost speechless with glad surprise, and then gasped
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did 'you hear THAT?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant such a ringing cheer burst out as wells spontaneously
      from the throats and hearts of men, in the first ecstatic moments of
      victory&mdash;a cheer to which our saddened hearts and enfeebled lungs had
      long been strangers. It was the genuine, honest, manly Northern cheer, as
      different from the shrill Rebel yell as the honest mastiff's deep-voiced
      welcome is from the howl of the prowling wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shout was taken up all over the prison. Even those who had not heard
      the guard understood that it meant that "Atlanta was ours and fairly won,"
      and they took up the acclamation with as much enthusiasm as we had begun
      it. All thoughts of sleep were put to flight: we would have a season of
      rejoicing. Little knots gathered together, debated the news, and indulged
      in the most sanguine hopes as to the effect upon the Rebels. In some parts
      of the Stockade stump speeches were made. I believe that Boston Corbett
      and his party organized a prayer and praise meeting. In our corner we
      stirred up our tuneful friend "Nosey," who sang again the grand old
      patriotic hymns that set our thin blood to bounding, and made us remember
      that we were still Union soldiers, with higher hopes than that of starving
      and dying in Andersonville. He sang the ever-glorious Star Spangled
      Banner, as he used to sing it around the camp fire in happier days, when
      we were in the field. He sang the rousing "Rally Round the Flag," with its
      wealth of patriotic fire and martial vigor, and we, with throats hoarse
      from shouting; joined in the chorus until the welkin rang again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebels became excited, lest our exaltation of spirits would lead to an
      assault upon the Stockade. They got under arms, and remained so until the
      enthusiasm became less demonstrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later&mdash;on the evening of the 6th of September&mdash;the
      Rebel Sergeants who called the roll entered the Stockade, and each
      assembling his squads, addressed them as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "PRISONERS: I am instructed by General Winder to inform you that a general
      exchange has been agreed upon. Twenty thousand men will be exchanged
      immediately at Savannah, where your vessels are now waiting for you.
      Detachments from One to Ten will prepare to leave early to-morrow
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement that this news produced was simply indescribable. I have
      seen men in every possible exigency that can confront men, and a large
      proportion viewed that which impended over them with at least outward
      composure. The boys around me had endured all that we suffered with
      stoical firmness. Groans from pain-racked bodies could not be repressed,
      and bitter curses and maledictions against the Rebels leaped unbidden to
      the lips at the slightest occasion, but there was no murmuring or whining.
      There was not a day&mdash;hardly an hour&mdash;in which one did not see
      such exhibitions of manly fortitude as made him proud of belonging to a
      race of which every individual was a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the emotion which pain and suffering and danger could not develop, joy
      could, and boys sang, and shouted and cried, and danced as if in a
      delirium. "God's country," fairer than the sweet promised land of Canaan
      appeared to the rapt vision of the Hebrew poet prophet, spread out in glad
      vista before the mind's eye of every one. It had come&mdash;at last it had
      come that which we had so longed for, wished for, prayed for, dreamed of;
      schemed, planned, toiled for, and for which went up the last earnest,
      dying wish of the thousands of our comrades who would now know no exchange
      save into that eternal "God's country" where

      Our "preparations," for leaving were few and simple. When the morning
      came, and shortly after the order to move, Andrews and I picked our
      well-worn blanket, our tattered overcoat, our rude chessmen, and no less
      rude board, our little black can, and the spoon made of hoop-iron, and
      bade farewell to the hole-in-the-ground that had been our home for nearly
      seven long months.
    </p>
    <p>
      My feet were still in miserable condition from the lacerations received in
      the attempt to escape, but I took one of our tent poles as a staff and
      hobbled away. We re-passed the gates which we had entered on that February
      night, ages since, it seemed, and crawled slowly over to the depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had come to regard the Rebels around us as such measureless liars that
      my first impulse was to believe the reverse of anything they said to us;
      and even now, while I hoped for the best, my old habit of mind was so
      strongly upon me that I had some doubts of our going to be exchanged,
      simply because it was a Rebel who had said so. But in the crowd of Rebels
      who stood close to the road upon which we were walking was a young Second
      Lieutenant, who said to a Colonel as I passed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weil, those fellows can sing 'Homeward Bound,' can't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This set my last misgiving at rest. Now I was certain that we were going
      to be exchanged, and my spirits soared to the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the cars we thumped and pounded toilsomely along, after the
      manner of Southern railroads, at the rate of six or eight miles an hour.
      Savannah was two hundred and forty miles away, and to our impatient minds
      it seemed as if we would never get there. The route lay the whole distance
      through the cheerless pine barrens which cover the greater part of
      Georgia. The only considerable town on the way was Macon, which had then a
      population of five thousand or thereabouts. For scores of miles there
      would not be a sign of a human habitation, and in the one hundred and
      eighty miles between Macon and Savannah there were only three
      insignificant villages. There was a station every ten miles, at which the
      only building was an open shed, to shelter from sun and rain a casual
      passenger, or a bit of goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasional specimens of the poor white "cracker" population that we
      saw, seemed indigenous products of the starved soil. They suited their
      poverty-stricken surroundings as well as the gnarled and scrubby
      vegetation suited the sterile sand. Thin-chested, round-shouldered,
      scraggy-bearded, dull-eyed and open-mouthed, they all looked alike&mdash;all
      looked as ignorant, as stupid, and as lazy as they were poor and weak.
      They were "low-downers" in every respect, and made our rough and simple.
      minded East Tennesseans look like models of elegant and cultured gentlemen
      in contrast. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp399" id="linkp399"></a>

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked on the poverty-stricken land with good-natured contempt, for we
      thought we were leaving it forever, and would soon be in one which,
      compared to it, was as the fatness at Egypt to the leanness of the desert
      of Sinai.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day after leaving Andersonville our train struggled across the
      swamps into Savannah, and rolled slowly down the live oak shaded streets
      into the center of the City. It seemed like another Deserted Village, so
      vacant and noiseless the streets, and the buildings everywhere so
      overgrown with luxuriant vegetation: The limbs of the shade trees crashed
      along and broke, upon the tops of our cars, as if no train had passed that
      way for years. Through the interstices between the trees and clumps of
      foliage could be seen the gleaming white marble of the monuments erected
      to Greene and Pulaski, looking like giant tombstones in a City of the
      Dead. The unbroken stillness&mdash;so different from what we expected on
      entering the metropolis of Georgia, and a City that was an important port
      in Revolutionary days&mdash;became absolutely oppressive. We could not
      understand it, but our thoughts were more intent upon the coming transfer
      to our flag than upon any speculation as to the cause of the remarkable
      somnolence of Savannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally some little boys straggled out to where our car was standing, and
      we opened up a conversation with them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, boys, are our vessels down in the harbor yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply came in that piercing treble shriek in which a boy of ten or
      twelve makes even his most confidential communications:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," (with our confidence in exchange somewhat dashed,) "they intend to
      exchange us here, don't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another falsetto scream, "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," (with something of a quaver in the questioner's voice,) "what are
      they going to do, with us, any way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O," (the treble shriek became almost demoniac) "they are fixing up a
      place over by the old jail for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sinking of hearts was there then! Andrews and I would not give up
      hope so speedily as some others did, and resolved to believe, for awhile
      at least, that we were going to be exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordered out of the cars, we were marched along the street. A crowd of
      small boys, full of the curiosity of the animal, gathered around us as we
      marched. Suddenly a door in a rather nice house opened; an angry-faced
      woman appeared on the steps and shouted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boys! BOYS! What are you doin' there! Come up on the steps immejitely!
      Come away from them n-a-s-t-y things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I will admit that we were not prepossessing in appearance; nor were we as
      cleanly as young gentlemen should habitually be; in fact, I may as well
      confess that I would not now, if I could help it, allow a tramp, as
      dilapidated in raiment, as unwashed, unshorn, uncombed, and populous with
      insects as we were, to come within several rods of me. Nevertheless, it
      was not pleasant to hear so accurate a description of our personal
      appearance sent forth on the wings of the wind by a shrill-voiced Rebel
      female.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short march brought us to the place "they were fixing for us by the old
      jail." It was another pen, with high walls of thick pine plank, which told
      us only too plainly how vain were our expectations of exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were turned inside, and I realized that the gates of another
      prison had closed upon me, hope forsook me. I flung our odious little
      possessions-our can, chess-board, overcoat, and blanket-upon the ground,
      and, sitting down beside them, gave way to the bitterest despair. I wanted
      to die, O, so badly. Never in all my life had I desired anything in the
      world so much as I did now to get out of it. Had I had pistol, knife,
      rope, or poison, I would have ended my prison life then and there, and
      departed with the unceremoniousness of a French leave. I remembered that I
      could get a quietus from a guard with very little trouble, but I would not
      give one of the bitterly hated Rebels the triumph of shooting me. I longed
      to be another Samson, with the whole Southern Confederacy gathered in
      another Temple of Dagon, that I might pull down the supporting pillars,
      and die happy in slaying thousands of my enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was thus sinking deeper and deeper in the Slough of Despond, the
      firing of a musket, and the shriek of the man who was struck, attracted my
      attention. Looking towards the opposite end of the pen I saw a guard
      bringing his still smoking musket to a "recover arms," and, not fifteen
      feet from him, a prisoner lying on the ground in the agonies of death. The
      latter had a pipe in his mouth when he was shot, and his teeth still
      clenched its stem. His legs and arms were drawn up convulsively, and he
      was rocking backward and forward on his back. The charge had struck him
      just above the hip-bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebel officer in command of the guard was sitting on his horse inside
      the pen at the time, and rode forward to see what the matter was.
      Lieutenant Davis, who had come with us from Andersonville, was also
      sitting on a horse inside the prison, and he called out in his usual
      harsh, disagreeable voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, Cunnel; the man's done just as I awdahed him to."
    </p>
    <p>
      I found that lying around inside were a number of bits of plank&mdash;each
      about five feet long, which had been sawed off by the carpenters engaged
      in building the prison. The ground being a bare common, was destitute of
      all shelter, and the pieces looked as if they would be quite useful in
      building a tent. There may have been an order issued forbidding the
      prisoners to touch them, but if so, I had not heard it, and I imagine the
      first intimation to the prisoner just killed that the boards were not to
      be taken was the bullet which penetrated his vitals. Twenty-five cents
      would be a liberal appraisement of the value of the lumber for which the
      boy lost his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterward we thought we saw all the guards march out of the
      front gate. There was still another pile of these same kind of pieces of
      board lying at the further side of the prison. The crowd around me noticed
      it, and we all made a rush for it. In spite of my lame feet I outstripped
      the rest, and was just in the act of stooping down to pick the boards up
      when a loud yell from those behind startled me. Glancing to my left I saw
      a guard cocking his gun and bringing it up to shoot me. With one
      frightened spring, as quick as a flash, and before he could cover me, I
      landed fully a rod back in the crowd, and mixed with it. The fellow tried
      hard to draw a bead on me, but I was too quick for him, and he finally
      lowered his gun with an oath expressive of disappointment in not being
      able to kill a Yankee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking back to my place the full ludicrousness of the thing dawned upon
      me so forcibly that I forgot all about my excitement and scare, and
      laughed aloud. Here, not an hour age I was murmuring because I could find
      no way to die; I sighed for death as a bridegroom for the coming of his
      bride, an yet, when a Rebel had pointed his gun at me, it had nearly
      scared me out of a year's growth, and made me jump farther than I could
      possibly do when my feet were well, and I was in good condition otherwise.

    <p>
      Andrews and I did not let the fate of the boy who was killed, nor my own
      narrow escape from losing the top of my head, deter us from farther
      efforts to secure possession of those coveted boards. My readers remember
      the story of the boy who, digging vigorously at a hole, replied to the
      remark of a passing traveler that there was probably no ground-hog there,
      and, even if there was, "ground-hog was mighty poor eatin', any way,"
      with:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mister, there's got to be a ground-hog there; our family's out o' meat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what actuated us: we were out of material for a tent. Our
      solitary blanket had rotted and worn full of holes by its long double
      duty, as bed-clothes and tent at Andersonville, and there was an
      imperative call for a substitute. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp406"
      id="linkp406"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrews and I flattered ourselves that when we matched our collective or
      individual wits against those of a Johnny his defeat was pretty certain,
      and with this cheerful estimate of our own powers to animate us, we set to
      work to steal the boards from under the guard's nose. The Johnny had
      malice in his heart and buck-and-ball in his musket, but his eyes were not
      sufficiently numerous to adequately discharge all the duties laid upon
      him. He had too many different things to watch at the same time. I would
      approach a gap in the fence not yet closed as if I intended making a dash
      through it for liberty, and when the Johnny had concentrated all his
      attention on letting me have the contents of his gun just as soon as he
      could have a reasonable excuse for doing so, Andrews would pick u a couple
      of boards and slip away with them. Then I would fall back in pretended
      (and some real) alarm, and&mdash;Andrew would come up and draw his
      attention by a similar feint, while I made off with a couple more pieces.
      After a few hours c this strategy, we found ourselves the possessors of
      some dozen planks, with which we made a lean-to, that formed a tolerable
      shelter for our heads and the upper portion of our bodies. As the boards
      were not over five feet long, and the slope reduce the sheltered space to
      about four-and-one-half feet, it left the lower part of our naked feet and
      legs to project out-of-doors. Andrews used to lament very touchingly the
      sunburning his toe-nails were receiving. He knew that his complexion was
      being ruined for life, and all the Balm of a Thousand Flowers in the world
      would not restore his comely ankles to that condition of pristine
      loveliness which would admit of their introduction into good society
      again. Another defect was that, like the fun in a practical joke, it was
      all on one side; there was not enough of it to go clear round. It was very
      unpleasant, when a storm came up in a direction different from that we had
      calculated upon, to be compelled to get out in the midst of it, and build
      our house over to face the other way. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a
      name="linkp405" id="linkp405"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Still we had a tent, and were that much better off than three-fourths of
      our comrades who had no shelter at all. We were owners of a brown stone
      front on Fifth Avenue compared to the other fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our tent erected, we began a general survey of our new abiding place. The
      ground was a sandy common in the outskirts of Savannah. The sand was
      covered with a light sod. The Rebels, who knew nothing of our burrowing
      propensities, had neglected to make the plank forming the walls of the
      Prison project any distance below the surface of the ground, and had put
      up no Dead Line around the inside; so that it looked as if everything was
      arranged expressly to invite us to tunnel out. We were not the boys to
      neglect such an invitation. By night about three thousand had been
      received from Andersonville, and placed inside. When morning came it
      looked as if a colony of gigantic rats had been at work. There was a
      tunnel every ten or fifteen feet, and at least twelve hundred of us had
      gone out through them during the night. I never understood why all in the
      pen did not follow our example, and leave the guards watching a forsaken
      Prison. There was nothing to prevent it. An hour's industrious work with a
      half-canteen would take any one outside, or if a boy was too lazy to dig
      his own tunnel, he could have the use of one of the hundred others that
      had been dug.
    </p>
    <p>
      But escaping was only begun when the Stockade was passed. The site of
      Savannah is virtually an island. On the north is the Savannah River; to
      the east, southeast and south, are the two Ogeechee rivers, and a chain of
      sounds and lagoons connecting with the Atlantic Ocean. To the west is a
      canal connecting the Savannah and Big Ogeechee Rivers. We found ourselves
      headed off by water whichever way we went. All the bridges were guarded,
      and all the boats destroyed. Early in the morning the Rebels discovered
      our absence, and the whole garrison of Savannah was sent out on patrol
      after us. They picked up the boys in squads of from ten to thirty, lurking
      around the shores of the streams waiting for night to come, to get across,
      or engaged in building rafts for transportation. By evening the whole mob
      of us were back in the pen again. As nobody was punished for running away,
      we treated the whole affair as a lark, and those brought back first stood
      around the gate and yelled derisively as the others came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night big fires were built all around the Stockade, and a line of
      guards placed on the ground inside of these. In spite of this precaution,
      quite a number escaped. The next day a Dead Line was put up inside of the
      Prison, twenty feet from the Stockade. This only increased the labor of
      burrowing, by making us go farther. Instead of being able to tunnel out in
      an hour, it now took three or four hours. That night several hundred of
      us, rested from our previous performance, and hopeful of better luck,
      brought our faithful half canteens&mdash;now scoured very bright by
      constant use-into requisition again, and before the morning. dawned we had
      gained the high reeds of the swamps, where we lay concealed until night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way we managed to evade the recapture that came to most of those
      who went out, but it was a fearful experience. Having been raised in a
      country where venomous snakes abounded, I had that fear and horror of them
      that inhabitants of those districts feel, and of which people living in
      sections free from such a scourge know little. I fancied that the Southern
      swamps were filled with all forms of loathsome and poisonous reptiles, and
      it required all my courage to venture into them barefooted. Besides, the
      snags and roots hurt our feet fearfully. Our hope was to find a boat
      somewhere, in which we could float out to sea, and trust to being picked
      up by some of the blockading fleet. But no boat could we find, with all
      our painful and diligent search. We learned afterward that the Rebels made
      a practice of breaking up all the boats along the shore to prevent negros
      and their own deserters from escaping to the blockading fleet. We thought
      of making a raft of logs, but had we had the strength to do this, we would
      doubtless have thought it too risky, since we dreaded missing the vessels,
      and being carried out to sea to perish of hunger. During the night we came
      to the railroad bridge across the Ogeechee. We had some slender hope that,
      if we could reach this we might perhaps get across the river, and find
      better opportunities for escape. But these last expectations were blasted
      by the discovery that it was guarded. There was a post and a fire on the
      shore next us, and a single guard with a lantern was stationed on one of
      the middle spans. Almost famished with hunger, and so weary and footsore
      that we could scarcely move another step, we went back to a cleared place
      on the high ground, and laid down to sleep, entirely reckless as to what
      became of us. Late in the morning we were awakened by the Rebel patrol and
      taken back to the prison. Lieutenant Davis, disgusted with the perpetual
      attempts to escape, moved the Dead Line out forty feet from the Stockade;
      but this restricted our room greatly, since the number of prisoners in the
      pen had now risen to about six thousand, and, besides, it offered little
      additional protection against tunneling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not much more difficult to dig fifty feet than it had been to dig
      thirty feet. Davis soon realized this, and put the Dead Line back to
      twenty feet. His next device was a much more sensible one. A crowd of one
      hundred and fifty negros dug a trench twenty feet wide and five feet deep
      around the whole prison on the outside, and this ditch was filled with
      water from the City Water Works. No one could cross this without
      attracting the attention of the guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still we were not discouraged, and Andrews and I joined a crowd that was
      constructing a large tunnel from near our quarters on the east side of the
      pen. We finished the burrow to within a few inches of the edge of the
      ditch, and then ceased operations, to await some stormy night, when we
      could hope to get across the ditch unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orders were issued to guards to fire without warning on men who were
      observed to be digging or carrying out dirt after nightfall. They
      occasionally did so, but the risk did not keep anyone from tunneling. Our
      tunnel ran directly under a sentry box. When carrying dirt away the bearer
      of the bucket had to turn his back on the guard and walk directly down the
      street in front of him, two hundred or three hundred feet, to the center
      of the camp, where he scattered the sand around&mdash;so as to give no
      indication of where it came from. Though we always waited till the moon
      went down, it seemed as if, unless the guard were a fool, both by nature
      and training, he could not help taking notice of what was going on under
      his eyes. I do not recall any more nervous promenades in my life, than
      those when, taking my turn, I received my bucket of sand at the mouth of
      the tunnel, and walked slowly away with it. The most disagreeable part was
      in turning my back to the guard. Could I have faced him, I had sufficient
      confidence in my quickness of perception, and talents as a dodger, to
      imagine that I could make it difficult for him to hit me. But in walling
      with my back to him I was wholly at his mercy. Fortune, however, favored
      us, and we were allowed to go on with our work&mdash;night after night&mdash;without
      a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile another happy thought slowly gestated in Davis's alleged
      intellect. How he came to give birth to two ideas with no more than a week
      between them, puzzled all who knew him, and still more that he survived
      this extraordinary strain upon the gray matter of the cerebrum. His new
      idea was to have driven a heavily-laden mule cart around the inside of the
      Dead Line at least once a day. The wheels or the mule's feet broke through
      the thin sod covering the tunnels and exposed them. Our tunnel went with
      the rest, and those of our crowd who wore shoes had humiliation added to
      sorrow by being compelled to go in and spade the hole full of dirt. This
      put an end to subterranean engineering. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a

      FRANK REVERSTOCK'S ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE&mdash;PASSING OFF AS REBEL BOY HE
      REACHES GRISWOLDVILLE BY RAIL, AND THEN STRIKES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR
      SHERMAN, BUT IS CAUGHT WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF OUR LINES.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the shrewdest and nearest successful attempts to escape that came
      under my notice was that of my friend Sergeant Frank Reverstock, of the
      Third West Virginia Cavalry, of whom I have before spoken. Frank, who was
      quite small, with a smooth boyish face, had converted to his own use a
      citizen's coat, belonging to a young boy, a Sutler's assistant, who had
      died in Andersonville. He had made himself a pair of bag pantaloons and a
      shirt from pieces of meal sacks which he had appropriated from day to day.
      He had also the Sutler's assistant's shoes, and, to crown all, he wore on
      his head one of those hideous looking hats of quilted calico which the
      Rebels had taken to wearing in the lack of felt hats, which they could
      neither make nor buy. Altogether Frank looked enough like a Rebel to be
      dangerous to trust near a country store or a stable full of horses. When
      we first arrived in the prison quite a crowd of the Savannahians rushed in
      to inspect us. The guards had some difficulty in keeping them and us
      separate. While perplexed with this annoyance, one of them saw Frank
      standing in our crowd, and, touching him with his bayonet, said, with some
      sharpness:
    </p>
    <p>
      "See heah; you must stand back; you musn't crowd on them prisoners so."

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p413.jpg (33K)" src="images/p413.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank stood back. He did it promptly but calmly, and then, as if his
      curiosity as to Yankees was fully satisfied, he walked slowly away up the
      street, deliberating as he went on a plan for getting out of the City. He
      hit upon an excellent one. Going to the engineer of a freight train making
      ready to start back to Macon, he told him that his father was working in
      the Confederate machine shops at Griswoldville, near Macon; that he
      himself was also one of the machinists employed there, and desired to go
      thither but lacked the necessary means to pay his passage. If the engineer
      would let him ride up on the engine he would do work enough to pay the
      fare. Frank told the story ingeniously, the engineer and firemen were won
      over, and gave their consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more zealous assistant ever climbed upon a tender than Frank proved to
      be. He loaded wood with a nervous industry, that stood him in place of
      great strength. He kept the tender in perfect order, and anticipated, as
      far as possible, every want of the engineer and his assistant. They were
      delighted with him, and treated him with the greatest kindness, dividing
      their food with him, and insisting that he should share their bed when
      they "laid by" for the night. Frank would have gladly declined this latter
      kindness with thanks, as he was conscious that the quantity of "graybacks"
      his clothing contained did not make him a very desirable sleeping
      companion for any one, but his friends were so pressing that he was
      compelled to accede.
    </p>
    <p>
      His greatest trouble was a fear of recognition by some one of the
      prisoners that were continually passing by the train load, on their way
      from Andersonville to other prisons. He was one of the best known of the
      prisoners in Andersonville; bright, active, always cheerful, and forever
      in motion during waking hours,&mdash;every one in the Prison speedily
      became familiar with him, and all addressed him as "Sergeant Frankie." If
      any one on the passing trains had caught a glimpse of him, that glimpse
      would have been followed almost inevitably with a shout of:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Sergeant Frankie! What are you doing there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the whole game would have been up. Frank escaped this by persistent
      watchfulness, and by busying himself on the opposite side of the engine,
      with his back turned to the other trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last when nearing Griswoldville, Frank, pointing to a large white house
      at some distance across the fields, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, right over there is where my uncle lives, and I believe I'll just
      run over and see him, and then walk into Griswoldville."
    </p>
    <p>
      He thanked his friends fervently for their kindness, promised to call and
      see them frequently, bade them good by, and jumped off the train. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <a name="linkp415" id="linkp415"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p415.jpg (22K)" src="images/p415.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked towards the white house as long as he thought he could be seen,
      and then entered a large corn field and concealed himself in a thicket in
      the center of it until dark, when he made his way to the neighboring
      woods, and began journeying northward as fast as his legs could carry him.
      When morning broke he had made good progress, but was terribly tired. It
      was not prudent to travel by daylight, so he gathered himself some ears of
      corn and some berries, of which he made his breakfast, and finding a
      suitable thicket he crawled into it, fell asleep, and did not wake up
      until late in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After another meal of raw corn and berries he resumed his journey, and
      that night made still better progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated this for several days and nights&mdash;lying in the woods in
      the day time, traveling by night through woods, fields, and by-paths
      avoiding all the fords, bridges and main roads, and living on what he
      could glean from the fields, that he might not take even so much risk as
      was involved in going to the negro cabins for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are always flaws in every man's armor of caution&mdash;even in
      so perfect a one as Frank's. His complete success so far had the natural
      effect of inducing a growing carelessness, which wrought his ruin. One
      evening he started off briskly, after a refreshing rest and sleep. He knew
      that he must be very near Sherman's lines, and hope cheered him up with
      the belief that his freedom would soon be won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending from the hill, in whose dense brushwood he had made his bed all
      day, he entered a large field full of standing corn, and made his way
      between the rows until he reached, on the other side, the fence that
      separated it from the main road, across which was another corn-field, that
      Frank intended entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he neglected his usual precautions on approaching a road, and instead
      of coming up cautiously and carefully reconnoitering in all directions
      before he left cover, he sprang boldly over the fence and strode out for
      the other side. As he reached the middle of the road, his ears were
      assailed with the sharp click of a musket being cocked, and the harsh
      command:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halt! halt, dah, I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning with a start to his left he saw not ten feet from him, a mounted
      patrol, the sound of whose approach had been masked by the deep dust of
      the road, into which his horse's hoofs sank noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank, of course, yielded without a word, and when sent to the officer in
      command he told the old story about his being an employee of the
      Griswoldville shops, off on a leave of absence to make a visit to sick
      relatives. But, unfortunately, his captors belonged to that section
      themselves, and speedily caught him in a maze of cross-questioning from
      which he could not extricate himself. It also became apparent from his
      language that he was a Yankee, and it was not far from this to the
      conclusion that he was a spy&mdash;a conclusion to which the proximity of
      Sherman's lines, then less than twenty miles distant-greatly assisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the next morning this belief had become so firmly fixed in the minds of
      the Rebels that Frank saw a halter dangling alarmingly near, and he
      concluded the wisest plan was to confess who he really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the smallest of his griefs to realize by how slight a chance he
      had failed. Had he looked down the road before he climbed the fence, or
      had he been ten minutes earlier or later, the patrol would not have been
      there, he could have gained the next field unperceived, and two more
      nights of successful progress would have taken him into Sherman's lines at
      Sand Mountain. The patrol which caught him was on the look-out for
      deserters and shirking conscripts, who had become unusually numerous since
      the fall of Atlanta.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sent back to us at Savannah. As he came into the prison gate
      Lieutenant Davis was standing near. He looked sternly at Frank and his
      Rebel garments, and muttering,
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, I'll stop this!" caught the coat by the tails, tore it to the
      collar, and took it and his hat away from Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange sequel to this episode. A few weeks afterward a
      special exchange for ten thousand was made, and Frank succeeded in being
      included in this. He was given the usual furlough from the paroled camp at
      Annapolis, and went to his home in a little town near Mansfield, O.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day while on the cars going&mdash;I think to Newark, O., he saw
      Lieutenant Davis on the train, in citizens' clothes. He had been sent by
      the Rebel Government to Canada with dispatches relating to some of the
      raids then harassing our Northern borders. Davis was the last man in the
      world to successfully disguise himself. He had a large, coarse mouth, that
      made him remembered by all who had ever seen him. Frank recognized him
      instantly and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are Lieutenant Davis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are totally mistaken, sah, I am &mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank insisted that he was right. Davis fumed and blustered, but though
      Frank was small, he was as game as a bantam rooster, and he gave Davis to
      understand that there had been a vast change in their relative positions;
      that the one, while still the same insolent swaggerer, had not regiments
      of infantry or batteries of artillery to emphasize his insolence, and the
      other was no longer embarrassed in the discussion by the immense odds in
      favor of his jailor opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a stormy scene Frank called in the assistance of some other soldiers
      in the car, arrested Davis, and took him to Camp Chase&mdash;near
      Columbus, O.,&mdash;where he was fully identified by a number of paroled
      prisoners. He was searched, and documents showing the nature of his
      mission beyond a doubt, were found upon his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      A court martial was immediately convened for his trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      This found him guilty, and sentenced him to be hanged as a spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the trial Frank stepped up to the prisoner and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Davis, I believe we're even on that coat, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis was sent to Johnson's Island for execution, but influences were
      immediately set at work to secure Executive clemency. What they were I
      know not, but I am informed by the Rev. Robert McCune, who was then
      Chaplain of the One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Ohio Infantry and the Post
      of Johnson's Island and who was the spiritual adviser appointed to prepare
      Davis for execution, that the sentence was hardly pronounced before Davis
      was visited by an emissary, who told him to dismiss his fears, that he
      should not suffer the punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is likely that leading Baltimore Unionists were enlisted in his behalf
      through family connections, and as the Border State Unionists were then
      potent at Washington, they readily secured a commutation of his sentence
      to imprisonment during the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that the justice of this world is very unevenly dispensed when so
      much solicitude is shown for the life of such a man, and none at all for
      the much better men whom he assisted to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official notice of the commutation of the sentence was not published
      until the day set for the execution, but the certain knowledge that it
      would be forthcoming enabled Davis to display a great deal of bravado on
      approaching what was supposed to be his end. As the reader can readily
      imagine, from what I have heretofore said of him, Davis was the man to
      improve to the utmost every opportunity to strut his little hour, and he
      did it in this instance. He posed, attitudinized and vapored, so that the
      camp and the country were filled with stories of the wonderful coolness
      with which he contemplated his approaching fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other things he said to his guard, as he washed himself elaborately
      the night before the day announced for the execution:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can be sure of one thing; to-morrow night there will certainly
      be one clean corpse on this Island."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for his braggadocio, he let it leak out in some way that he
      had been well aware all the time that he would not be executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taken to Fort Delaware for confinement, and died there some time
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Beverstock went back to his regiment, and served with it until the
      close of the war. He then returned home, and, after awhile became a banker
      at Bowling Green, O. He was a fine business man and became very
      prosperous. But though naturally healthy and vigorous, his system carried
      in it the seeds of death, sown there by the hardships of captivity. He had
      been one of the victims of the Rebels' vaccination; the virus injected
      into his blood had caused a large part of his right temple to slough off,
      and when it healed it left a ghastly cicatrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years ago he was taken suddenly ill, and died before his friends had
      any idea that his condition was serious. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      SAVANNAH PROVES TO BE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER&mdash;ESCAPE FROM THE BRATS
      OF GUARDS&mdash;COMPARISON BETWEEN WIRZ AND DAVIS&mdash;A BRIEF INTERVAL
      OF GOOD RATIONS&mdash;WINDER, THE MAN WITH THE EVIL EYE &mdash;THE
      DISLOYAL WORK OF A SHYSTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all Savannah was a wonderful improvement on Andersonville. We got
      away from the pestilential Swamp and that poisonous ground. Every mouthful
      of air was not laden with disease germs, nor every cup of water polluted
      with the seeds of death. The earth did not breed gangrene, nor the
      atmosphere promote fever. As only the more vigorous had come away, we were
      freed from the depressing spectacle of every third man dying. The keen
      disappointment prostrated very many who had been of average health, and I
      imagine, several hundred died, but there were hospital arrangements of
      some kind, and the sick were taken away from among us. Those of us who
      tunneled out had an opportunity of stretching our legs, which we had not
      had for months in the overcrowded Stockade we had left. The attempts to
      escape did all engaged in them good, even though they failed, since they
      aroused new ideas and hopes, set the blood into more rapid circulation,
      and toned up the mind and system both. I had come away from Andersonville
      with considerable scurvy manifesting itself in my gums and feet. Soon
      these signs almost wholly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also got away from those murderous little brats of Reserves, who
      guarded us at Andersonville, and shot men down as they would stone apples
      out of a tree. Our guards now were mostly, sailors, from the Rebel fleet
      in the harbor&mdash;Irishmen, Englishmen and Scandinavians, as free
      hearted and kindly as sailors always are. I do not think they ever fired a
      shot at one of us. The only trouble we had was with that portion of the
      guard drawn from the infantry of the garrison. They had the same
      rattlesnake venom of the Home Guard crowd wherever we met it, and shot us
      down at the least provocation. Fortunately they only formed a small part
      of the sentinels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best of all, we escaped for a while from the upas-like shadow of Winder
      and Wirz, in whose presence strong men sickened and died, as when near
      some malign genii of an Eastern story. The peasantry of Italy believed
      firmly in the evil eye. Did they ever know any such men as Winder and his
      satellite, I could comprehend how much foundation they could have for such
      a belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Davis had many faults, but there was no comparison between him
      and the Andersonville commandant. He was a typical young Southern man;
      ignorant and bumptious as to the most common matters of school-boy
      knowledge, inordinately vain of himself and his family, coarse in tastes
      and thoughts, violent in his prejudices, but after all with some streaks
      of honor and generosity that made the widest possible difference between
      him and Wirz, who never had any. As one of my chums said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wirz is the most even-tempered man I ever knew; he's always foaming mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was nearly the truth. I never saw Wirz when he was not angry; if not
      violently abusive, he was cynical and sardonic. Never, in my little
      experience with him did I detect a glint of kindly, generous humanity; if
      he ever was moved by any sight of suffering its exhibition in his face
      escaped my eye. If he ever had even a wish to mitigate the pain or
      hardship of any man the expression of such wish never fell on my ear. How
      a man could move daily through such misery as he encountered, and never be
      moved by it except to scorn and mocking is beyond my limited
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis vapored a great deal, swearing big round oaths in the broadest of
      Southern patois; he was perpetually threatening to:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open on ye wid de ahtillery," but the only death that I knew him to
      directly cause or sanction was that I have described in the previous
      chapter. He would not put himself out of the way to annoy and oppress
      prisoners, as Wirz would, but frequently showed even a disposition to
      humor them in some little thing, when it could be done without danger or
      trouble to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, however, he got an idea that there was some money to be made
      out of the prisoners, and he set his wits to work in this direction. One
      day, standing at the gate, he gave one of his peculiar yells that he used
      to attract the attention of the camp with:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wh-ah-ye!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We all came to "attention," and he announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday, while I wuz in the camps (a Rebel always says camps,) some of
      you prisoners picked my pockets of seventy-five dollars in greenbacks.
      Now, I give you notice that I'll not send in any moah rations till the
      money's returned to me." <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp422"
      id="linkp422"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p422.jpg (48K)" src="images/p422.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a very stupid method of extortion, since no one believed that he
      had lost the money, and at all events he had no business to have the
      greenbacks, as the Rebel laws imposed severe penalties upon any citizen,
      and still more upon any soldier dealing with, or having in his possession
      any of "the money of the enemy." We did without rations until night, when
      they were sent in. There was a story that some of the boys in the prison
      had contributed to make up part of the sum, and Davis took it and was
      satisfied. I do not know how true the story was. At another time some of
      the boys stole the bridle and halter off an old horse that was driven in
      with a cart. The things were worth, at a liberal estimate, one dollar.
      Davis cut off the rations of the whole six thousand of us for one day for
      this. We always imagined that the proceeds went into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      A special exchange was arranged between our Navy Department and that of
      the Rebels, by which all seamen and marines among us were exchanged. Lists
      of these were sent to the different prisons and the men called for. About
      three-fourths of them were dead, but many soldiers divining, the situation
      of affairs, answered to the dead men's names, went away with the squad and
      were exchanged. Much of this was through the connivance of the Rebel
      officers, who favored those who had ingratiated themselves with them. In
      many instances money was paid to secure this privilege, and I have been
      informed on good authority that Jack Huckleby, of the Eighth Tennessee,
      and Ira Beverly, of the One Hundredth Ohio, who kept the big sutler shop
      on the North Side at Andersonville, paid Davis five hundred dollars each
      to be allowed to go with the sailors. As for Andrews and me, we had no
      friends among the Rebels, nor money to bribe with, so we stood no show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rations issued to us for some time after our arrival seemed riotous
      luxury to what we had been getting at Andersonville. Each of us received
      daily a half-dozen rude and coarse imitations of our fondly-remembered
      hard tack, and with these a small piece of meat or a few spoonfuls of
      molasses, and a quart or so of vinegar, and several plugs of tobacco for
      each "hundred." How exquisite was the taste of the crackers and molasses!
      It was the first wheat bread I had eaten since my entry into Richmond
      &mdash;nine months before&mdash;and molasses had been a stranger to me for
      years. After the corn bread we had so long lived upon, this was manna. It
      seems that the Commissary at Savannah labored under the delusion that he
      must issue to us the same rations as were served out to the Rebel soldiers
      and sailors. It was some little time before the fearful mistake came to
      the knowledge of Winder. I fancy that the news almost threw him into an
      apoplectic fit. Nothing, save his being ordered to the front, could have
      caused him such poignant sorrow as the information that so much good food
      had been worse than wasted in undoing his work by building up the bodies
      of his hated enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being told, we knew that he had been heard from when the tobacco,
      vinegar and molasses failed to come in, and the crackers gave way to corn
      meal. Still this was a vast improvement on Andersonville, as the meal was
      fine and sweet, and we each had a spoonful of salt issued to us regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am quite sure that I cannot make the reader who has not had an
      experience similar to ours comprehend the wonderful importance to us of
      that spoonful of salt. Whether or not the appetite for salt be, as some
      scientists claim, a purely artificial want, one thing is certain, and that
      is, that either the habit of countless generations or some other cause,
      has so deeply ingrained it into our common nature, that it has come to be
      nearly as essential as food itself, and no amount of deprivation can
      accustom us to its absence. Rather, it seemed that the longer we did
      without it the more overpowering became our craving. I could get along
      to-day and to-morrow, perhaps the whole week, without salt in my food,
      since the lack would be supplied from the excess I had already swallowed,
      but at the end of that time Nature would begin to demand that I renew the
      supply of saline constituent of my tissues, and she would become more
      clamorous with every day that I neglected her bidding, and finally summon

      The light artillery of the garrison of Savannah&mdash;four batteries,
      twenty-four pieces&mdash;was stationed around three sides of the prison,
      the guns unlimbered, planted at convenient distance, and trained upon us,
      ready for instant use. We could see all the grinning mouths through the
      cracks in the fence. There were enough of them to send us as high as the
      traditional kite flown by Gilderoy. The having at his beck this array of
      frowning metal lent Lieutenant Davis such an importance in his own eyes
      that his demeanor swelled to the grandiose. It became very amusing to see
      him puff up and vaunt over it, as he did on every possible occasion. For
      instance, finding a crowd of several hundred lounging around the gate, he
      would throw open the wicket, stalk in with the air of a Jove threatening a
      rebellious world with the dread thunders of heaven, and shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      "W-h-a-a y-e-e! Prisoners, I give you jist two minutes to cleah away from
      this gate, aw I'll open on ye wid de ahtillery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the buglers of the artillery was a superb musician&mdash;evidently
      some old "regular" whom the Confederacy had seduced into its service, and
      his instrument was so sweet toned that we imagined that it was made of
      silver. The calls he played were nearly the same as we used in the
      cavalry, and for the first few days we became bitterly homesick every time
      he sent ringing out the old familiar signals, that to us were so closely
      associated with what now seemed the bright and happy days when we were in
      the field with our battalion. If we were only back in the valleys of
      Tennessee with what alacrity we would respond to that "assembly;" no
      Orderly's patience would be worn out in getting laggards and lazy ones to
      "fall in for roll-call;" how eagerly we would attend to "stable duty;" how
      gladly mount our faithful horses and ride away to "water," and what
      bareback races ride, going and coming. We would be even glad to hear
      "guard" and "drill" sounded; and there would be music in the disconsolate
      "surgeon's call:"
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Come-get-your-q-n-i-n-i-n-e; come, get your quinine; It'll make you
          sad: It'll make you sick. Come, come."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      O, if we were only back, what admirable soldiers we would be! One morning,
      about three or four o'clock, we were awakened by the ground shaking and a
      series of heavy, dull thumps sounding oft seaward. Our silver-voiced
      bugler seemed to be awakened, too. He set the echoes ringing with a
      vigorously played "reveille;" a minute later came an equally earnest
      "assembly," and when "boots and saddles" followed, we knew that all was
      not well in Denmark; the thumping and shaking now had a significance. It
      meant heavy Yankee guns somewhere near. We heard the gunners hitching up;
      the bugle signal "forward," the wheels roll off, and for a half hour
      afterwards we caught the receding sound of the bugle commanding "right
      turn," "left turn," etc., as the batteries marched away. Of course, we
      became considerably wrought up over the matter, as we fancied that,
      knowing we were in Savannah, our vessels were trying to pass up to the
      City and take it. The thumping and shaking continued until late in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We subsequently learned that some of our blockaders, finding time banging
      heavy upon their hands, had essayed a little diversion by knocking Forts
      Jackson and Bledsoe&mdash;two small forts defending the passage of the
      Savannah&mdash;about their defenders' ears. After capturing the forts our
      folks desisted and came no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a number of the old Raider crowd had come with us from
      Andersonville. Among these was the shyster, Peter Bradley. They kept up
      their old tactics of hanging around the gates, and currying favor with the
      Rebels in every possible way, in hopes to get paroles outside or other
      favors. The great mass of the prisoners were so bitter against the Rebels
      as to feel that they would rather die than ask or accept a favor from
      their hands, and they had little else than contempt for these trucklers.
      The raider crowd's favorite theme of conversation with the Rebels was the
      strong discontent of the boys with the manner of their treatment by our
      Government. The assertion that there was any such widespread feeling was
      utterly false. We all had confidence&mdash;as we continue to have to this
      day&mdash;that our Government would do everything for us possible,
      consistent with its honor, and the success of military operations, and
      outside of the little squad of which I speak, not an admission could be
      extracted from anybody that blame could be attached to any one, except the
      Rebels. It was regarded as unmanly and unsoldier-like to the last degree,
      as well as senseless, to revile our Government for the crimes committed by
      its foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Rebels were led to believe that we were ripe for revolt against
      our flag, and to side with them. Imagine, if possible, the stupidity that
      would mistake our bitter hatred of those who were our deadly enemies, for
      any feeling that would lead us to join hands with those enemies. One day
      we were surprised to see the carpenters erect a rude stand in the center
      of the camp. When it was finished, Bradley appeared upon it, in company
      with some Rebel officers and guards. We gathered around in curiosity, and
      Bradley began making a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that it had now become apparent to all of us that our Government
      had abandoned us; that it cared little or nothing for us, since it could
      hire as many more quite readily, by offering a bounty equal to the pay
      which would be due us now; that it cost only a few hundred dollars to
      bring over a shipload of Irish, "Dutch," and French, who were only too
      glad to agree to fight or do anything else to get to this country. [The
      peculiar impudence of this consisted in Bradley himself being a foreigner,
      and one who had only come out under one of the later calls, and the
      influence of a big bounty.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing in this strain he repeated and dwelt upon the old lie, always
      in the mouths of his crowd, that Secretary Stanton and General Halleck had
      positively refused to enter upon negotiations for exchange, because those
      in prison were "only a miserable lot of 'coffee-boilers' and 'blackberry
      pickers,' whom the Army was better off without."
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms "coffee-boiler," and "blackberry-pickers" were considered the
      worst terms of opprobrium we had in prison. They were applied to that
      class of stragglers and skulkers, who were only too ready to give
      themselves up to the enemy, and who, on coming in, told some gauzy story
      about "just having stopped to boil a cup of coffee," or to do something
      else which they should not have done, when they were gobbled up. It is not
      risking much to affirm the probability of Bradley and most of his crowd
      having belonged to this dishonorable class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assertion that either the great Chief-of-Staff or the still greater
      War-Secretary were even capable of applying such epithets to the mass of
      prisoners is too preposterous to need refutation, or even denial. No
      person outside the raider crowd ever gave the silly lie a moment's
      toleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley concluded his speech in some such language as this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, fellow prisoners, I propose to you this: that we unite in
      informing our Government that unless we are exchanged in thirty days, we
      will be forced by self-preservation to join the Confederate army."
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant his hearers seemed stunned at the fellow's audacity, and
      then there went up such a roar of denunciation and execration that the air
      trembled. The Rebels thought that the whole camp was going to rush on
      Bradley and tear him to pieces, and they drew revolvers and leveled
      muskets to defend him. The uproar only ceased when Bradley was hurried out
      of the prisons but for hours everybody was savage and sullen, and full of
      threatenings against him, when opportunity served. We never saw him
      afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angry as I was, I could not help being amused at the tempestuous rage of a
      tall, fine-looking and well educated Irish Sergeant of an Illinois
      regiment. He poured forth denunciations of the traitor and the Rebels,
      with the vivid fluency of his Hibernian nature, vowed he'd "give a year of
      me life, be J&mdash;-s, to have the handling of the dirty spalpeen for ten
      minutes; be G-d," and finally in his rage, tore off his own shirt and
      threw it on the ground and trampled on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine my astonishment, some time after getting out of prison, to find
      the Southern papers publishing as a defense against the charges in regard
      to Andersonville, the following document, which they claimed to have been
      adopted by "a mass meeting of the prisoners:" <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a mass meeting held September 28th, 1864, by the Federal prisoners
      confined at Savannah, Ga., it was unanimously agreed that the following
      resolutions be sent to the President of the United States, in the hope
      that he might thereby take such steps as in his wisdom he may think
      necessary for our speedy exchange or parole:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That while we would declare our unbounded love for the Union,
      for the home of our fathers, and for the graves of those we venerate, we
      would beg most respectfully that our situation as prisoners be diligently
      inquired into, and every obstacle consistent with the honor and dignity of
      the Government at once removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That while allowing the Confederate authorities all due praise
      for the attention paid to prisoners, numbers of our men are daily
      consigned to early graves, in the prime of manhood, far from home and
      kindred, and this is not caused intentionally by the Confederate
      Government, but by force of circumstances; the prisoners are forced to go
      without shelter, and, in a great portion of cases, without medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That, whereas, ten thousand of our brave comrades have
      descended into an untimely grave within the last six months, and as we
      believe their death was caused by the difference of climate, the peculiar
      kind and insufficiency of food, and lack of proper medical treatment; and,
      whereas, those difficulties still remain, we would declare as our firm
      belief, that unless we are speedily exchanged, we have no alternative but
      to share the lamentable fate of our comrades. Must this thing still go on!
      Is there no hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That, whereas, the cold and inclement season of the year is
      fast approaching, we hold it to be our duty as soldiers and citizens of
      the United States, to inform our Government that the majority of our
      prisoners ate without proper clothing, in some cases being almost naked,
      and are without blankets to protect us from the scorching sun by day or
      the heavy dews by night, and we would most respectfully request the
      Government to make some arrangement whereby we can be supplied with these,
      to us, necessary articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That, whereas, the term of service of many of our comrades
      having expired, they, having served truly and faithfully for the term of
      their several enlistments, would most respectfully ask their Government,
      are they to be forgotten? Are past services to be ignored? Not having seen
      their wives and little ones for over three years, they would most
      respectfully, but firmly, request the Government to make some arrangements
      whereby they can be exchanged or paroled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That, whereas, in the fortune of war, it was our lot to become
      prisoners, we have suffered patiently, and are still willing to suffer, if
      by so doing we can benefit the country; but we must most respectfully beg
      to say, that we are not willing to suffer to further the ends of any party
      or clique to the detriment of our honor, our families, and our country,
      and we beg that this affair be explained to us, that we may continue to
      hold the Government in that respect which is necessary to make a good
      citizen and soldier.

      possible for a mass meeting of prisoners to have been held without my
      knowing it, and its essential features. Still less was it possible for a
      mass meeting to have been held which would have adopted any such a
      document as the above, or anything else that a Rebel would have found the

    <p>
      WHY WE WERE HURRIED OUT OF ANDERSONVILLE&mdash;THE FALL OF ATLANTA &mdash;OUR
      LONGING TO HEAR THE NEWS&mdash;ARRIVAL OF SOME FRESH FISH&mdash;HOW WE
      KNEW THEY WERE WESTERN BOYS&mdash;DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE
      SOLDIERS OF THE TWO ARMIES.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason of our being hurried out of Andersonville under the false
      pretext of exchange dawned on us before we had been in Savannah long. If
      the reader will consult the map of Georgia he will understand this, too.
      Let him remember that several of the railroads which now appear were not
      built then. The road upon which Andersonville is situated was about one
      hundred and twenty miles long, reaching from Macon to Americus,
      Andersonville being about midway between these two. It had no connections
      anywhere except at Macon, and it was hundreds of miles across the country
      from Andersonville to any other road. When Atlanta fell it brought our
      folks to within sixty miles of Macon, and any day they were liable to make
      a forward movement, which would capture that place, and have us where we
      could be retaken with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing left undone to rouse the apprehensions of the Rebels in
      that direction. The humiliating surrender of General Stoneman at Macon in
      July, showed them what our, folks were thinking of and awakened their
      minds to the disastrous consequences of such a movement when executed by a
      bolder and abler commander. Two days of one of Kilpatrick's swift, silent
      marches would carry his hard-riding troopers around Hood's right flank,
      and into the streets of Macon, where a half hour's work with the torch on
      the bridges across the Ocmulgee and the creeks that enter it at that
      point, would have cut all of the Confederate Army of the Tennessee's
      communications. Another day and night of easy marching would bring his
      guidons fluttering through the woods about the Stockade at Andersonville,
      and give him a reinforcement of twelve or fifteen thousand able-bodied
      soldiers, with whom he could have held the whole Valley of the
      Chattahoochie, and become the nether millstone, against which Sherman
      could have ground Hood's army to powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a thing was not only possible, but very probable, and doubtless would
      have occurred had we remained in Andersonville another week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the haste to get us away, and hence the lie about exchange, for, had
      it not been for this, one-quarter at least of those taken on the cars
      would have succeeded in getting off and attempted to have reached
      Sherman's lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The removal went on with such rapidity that by the end of September only
      eight thousand two hundred and eighteen remained at Andersonville, and
      these were mostly too sick to be moved; two thousand seven hundred died in
      September, fifteen hundred and sixty in October, and four hundred and
      eighty-five in November, so that at the beginning of December there were
      only thirteen hundred and fifty-nine remaining. The larger part of those
      taken out were sent on to Charleston, and subsequently to Florence and
      Salisbury. About six or seven thousand of us, as near as I remember, were
      brought to Savannah. <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all exceedingly anxious to know how the Atlanta campaign had
      ended. So far our information only comprised the facts that a sharp battle
      had been fought, and the result was the complete possession of our great
      objective point. The manner of accomplishing this glorious end, the
      magnitude of the engagement, the regiments, brigades and corps
      participating, the loss on both sides, the completeness of the victories,
      etc., were all matters that we knew nothing of, and thirsted to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebel papers said as little as possible about the capture, and the
      facts in that little were so largely diluted with fiction as to convey no
      real information. But few new, prisoners were coming in, and none of these
      were from Sherman. However, toward the last of September, a handful of
      "fresh fish" were turned inside, whom our experienced eyes instantly told
      us were Western boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was never any difficulty in telling, as far as he could be seen,
      whether a boy belonged to the East or the west. First, no one from the
      Army of the Potomac was ever without his corps badge worn conspicuously;
      it was rare to see such a thing on one of Sherman's men. Then there was a
      dressy air about the Army of the Potomac that was wholly wanting in the
      soldiers serving west of the Alleghanies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Army, of the Potomac was always near to its base of supplies, always
      had its stores accessible, and the care of the clothing and equipments of
      the men was an essential part of its discipline. A ragged or shabbily
      dressed man was a rarity. Dress coats, paper collars, fresh woolen shirts,
      neat-fitting pantaloons, good comfortable shoes, and trim caps or hats,
      with all the blazing brass of company letters an inch long, regimental
      number, bugle and eagle, according to the Regulations, were as common to
      Eastern boys as they were rare among the Westerners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter usually wore blouses, instead of dress coats, and as a rule
      their clothing had not been renewed since the opening, of the campaign
      &mdash;and it showed this. Those who wore good boots or shoes generally
      had to submit to forcible exchanges by their captors, and the same was
      true of head gear. The Rebels were badly off in regard to hats. They did
      not have skill and ingenuity enough to make these out of felt or straw,
      and the make-shifts they contrived of quilted calico and long-leaved pine,
      were ugly enough to frighten horned cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never blamed them much for wanting to get rid of these, even if they did
      have to commit a sort of highway robbery upon defenseless prisoners to do
      so. To be a traitor in arms was bad certainly, but one never appreciated
      the entire magnitude of the crime until he saw a Rebel wearing a calico or
      a pine-leaf hat. Then one felt as if it would be a great mistake to ever
      show such a man mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Army of Northern Virginia seemed to have supplied themselves with
      head-gear of Yankee manufacture of previous years, and they then quit
      taking the hats of their prisoners. Johnston's Army did not have such good
      luck, and had to keep plundering to the end of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing about the Army of the Potomac was the variety of the
      uniforms. There were members of Zouave regiments, wearing baggy breeches
      of various hues, gaiters, crimson fezes, and profusely braided jackets. I
      have before mentioned the queer garb of the "Lost Ducks." (Les Enfants
      Perdu, Forty-eighth New York.)
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most striking uniforms was that of the "Fourteenth Brooklyn."
      They wore scarlet pantaloons, a blue jacket handsomely braided, and a red
      fez, with a white cloth wrapped around the head, turban-fashion. As a
      large number of them were captured, they formed quite a picturesque
      feature of every crowd. They were generally good fellows and gallant
      soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another uniform that attracted much, though not so favorable, attention
      was that of the Third New Jersey Cavalry, or First New Jersey Hussars, as
      they preferred to call themselves. The designer of the uniform must have
      had an interest in a curcuma plantation, or else he was a fanatical
      Orangeman. Each uniform would furnish occasion enough for a dozen New York
      riots on the 12th of July. Never was such an eruption of the yellows seen
      outside of the jaundiced livery of some Eastern potentate. Down each leg
      of the pantaloons ran a stripe of yellow braid one and one-half inches
      wide. The jacket had enormous gilt buttons, and was embellished with
      yellow braid until it was difficult to tell whether it was blue cloth
      trimmed with yellow, or yellow adorned with blue. From the shoulders swung
      a little, false hussar jacket, lined with the same flaring yellow. The
      vizor-less cap was similarly warmed up with the hue of the perfected
      sunflower. Their saffron magnificence was like the gorgeous gold of the
      lilies of the field, and Solomon in all his glory could not have beau
      arrayed like one of them. I hope he was not. I want to retain my respect
      for him. We dubbed these daffodil cavaliers "Butterflies," and the name
      stuck to them like a poor relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another distinction that was always noticeable between the two
      armies was in the bodily bearing of the men. The Army of the Potomac was
      drilled more rigidly than the Western men, and had comparatively few long
      marches. Its members had something of the stiffness and precision of
      English and German soldiery, while the Western boys had the long, "reachy"
      stride, and easy swing that made forty miles a day a rather commonplace
      march for an infantry regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was why we knew the new prisoners to be Sherman's boys as soon as
      they came inside, and we started for them to hear the news. Inviting them
      over to our lean-to, we told them our anxiety for the story of the
      decisive blow that gave us the Central Gate of the Confederacy, and asked
      them to give it to us. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      An intelligent, quick-eyed, sunburned boy, without an ounce of surplus
      flesh on face or limbs, which had been reduced to gray-hound condition by
      the labors and anxieties of the months of battling between Chattanooga and
      Atlanta, seemed to be the accepted talker of the crowd, since all the rest
      looked at him, as if expecting him to answer for them. He did so:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to know about how we got Atlanta at last, do you? Well, if you
      don't know, I should think you would want to. If I didn't, I'd want
      somebody to tell me all about it just as soon as he could get to me, for
      it was one of the neatest little bits of work that 'old Billy' and his

      "Well, first, I'll tell you that we belong to the old Fourteenth Ohio
      Volunteers, which, if you know anything about the Army of the Cumberland,
      you'll remember has just about as good a record as any that trains around
      old Pap Thomas&mdash;and he don't 'low no slouches of any kind near him,
      either&mdash;you can bet $500 to a cent on that, and offer to give back
      the cent if you win. Ours is Jim Steedman's old regiment&mdash;you've all
      heard of old Chickamauga Jim, who slashed his division of 7,000 fresh men
      into the Rebel flank on the second day at Chickamauga, in a way that made
      Longstreet wish he'd staid on the Rappahannock, and never tried to get up
      any little sociable with the Westerners. If I do say it myself, I believe
      we've got as good a crowd of square, stand-up,
      trust'em-every-minute-in-your-life boys, as ever thawed hard-tack and
      sowbelly. We got all the grunters and weak sisters fanned out the first
      year, and since then we've been on a business basis, all the time. We're
      in a mighty good brigade, too. Most of the regiments have been with us
      since we formed the first brigade Pap Thomas ever commanded, and waded
      with him through the mud of Kentucky, from Wild Cat to Mill Springs, where
      he gave Zollicoffer just a little the awfulest thrashing that a Rebel
      General ever got. That, you know, was in January, 1862, and was the first
      victory gained by the Western Army, and our people felt so rejoiced over
      it that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; we've read all about that," we broke in, "and we'd like to hear
      it again, some other time; but tell us now about Atlanta."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Let's see: where was I? O, yes, talking about our brigade. It
      is the Third Brigade, of the Third Division, of the Fourteenth Corps, and
      is made up of the Fourteenth Ohio, Thirty-eighth Ohio, Tenth Kentucky, and
      Seventy-fourth Indiana. Our old Colonel&mdash;George P. Este &mdash;commands
      it. We never liked him very well in camp, but I tell you he's a whole team
      in a fight, and he'd do so well there that all would take to him again,
      and he'd be real popular for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, isn't that strange," broke in Andrews, who was given to fits of
      speculation of psychological phenomena: "None of us yearn to die, but the
      surest way to gain the affection of the boys is to show zeal in leading
      them into scrapes where the chances of getting shot are the best. Courage
      in action, like charity, covers a multitude of sins. I have known it to
      make the most unpopular man in the battalion, the most popular inside of
      half an hour. Now, M.(addressing himself to me,) you remember Lieutenant
      H., of our battalion. You know he was a very fancy young fellow; wore as
      snipish' clothes as the tailor could make, had gold lace on his jacket
      wherever the regulations would allow it, decorated his shoulders with the
      stunningest pair of shoulder knots I ever saw, and so on. Well, he did not
      stay with us long after we went to the front. He went back on a detail for
      a court martial, and staid a good while. When he rejoined us, he was not
      in good odor, at all, and the boys weren't at all careful in saying
      unpleasant things when he could hear them, A little while after he came
      back we made that reconnaissance up on the Virginia Road. We stirred up
      the Johnnies with our skirmish line, and while the firing was going on in
      front we sat on our horses in line, waiting for the order to move forward
      and engage. You know how solemn such moments are. I looked down the line
      and saw Lieutenant H. at the right of Company&mdash;, in command of it. I
      had not seen him since he came back, and I sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Hello, Lieutenant, how do you feel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reply came back, promptly, and with boyish cheerfulness:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bully, by &mdash;&mdash;; I'm going to lead seventy men of Company into
      action today!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "How his boys did cheer him. When the bugle sounded&mdash;'forward, trot,'
      his company sailed in as if they meant it, and swept the Johnnies off in
      short meter. You never heard anybody say anything against Lieutenant after
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know how it was with Captain G., of our regiment," said one of the
      Fourteenth to another. "He was promoted from Orderly Sergeant to a Second
      Lieutenant, and assigned to Company D. All the members of Company D went
      to headquarters in a body, and protested against his being put in their
      company, and he was not. Well, he behaved so well at Chickamauga that the
      boys saw that they had done him a great injustice, and all those that
      still lived went again to headquarters, and asked to take all back that
      they had said, and to have him put into the company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that was doing the manly thing, sure; but go on about Atlanta."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was telling about our brigade," resumed the narrator. "Of course, we
      think our regiment's the best by long odds in the army&mdash;every fellow
      thinks that of his regiment&mdash;but next to it come the other regiments
      of our brigade. There's not a cent of discount on any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sherman had stretched out his right away to the south and west of
      Atlanta. About the middle of August our corps, commanded by Jefferson C.
      Davis, was lying in works at Utoy Creek, a couple of miles from Atlanta.
      We could see the tall steeples and the high buildings of the City quite
      plainly. Things had gone on dull and quiet like for about ten days. This
      was longer by a good deal than we had been at rest since we left Resaca in
      the Spring. We knew that something was brewing, and that it must come to a
      head soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I belong to Company C. Our little mess&mdash;now reduced to three by the
      loss of two of our best soldiers and cooks, Disbrow and Sulier, killed
      behind head-logs in front of Atlanta, by sharpshooters&mdash;had one
      fellow that we called 'Observer,' because he had such a faculty of picking
      up news in his prowling around headquarters. He brought us in so much of
      this, and it was generally so reliable that we frequently made up his
      absence from duty by taking his place. He was never away from a fight,
      though. On the night of the 25th of August, 'Observer' came in with the
      news that something was in the wind. Sherman was getting awful restless,
      and we had found out that this always meant lots of trouble to our friends
      on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure enough, orders came to get ready to move, and the next night we all
      moved to the right and rear, out of sight of the Johnnies. Our well built
      works were left in charge of Garrard's Cavalry, who concealed their horses
      in the rear, and came up and took our places. The whole army except the
      Twentieth Corps moved quietly off, and did it so nicely that we were gone
      some time before the enemy suspected it. Then the Twentieth Corps pulled
      out towards the North, and fell back to the Chattahoochie, making quite a
      shove of retreat. The Rebels snapped up the bait greedily. They thought
      the siege was being raised, and they poured over their works to hurry the
      Twentieth boys off. The Twentieth fellows let them know that there was
      lots of sting in them yet, and the Johnnies were not long in discovering
      that it would have been money in their pockets if they had let that
      'moon-and-star' (that's the Twentieth's badge, you know) crowd alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Rebs thought the rest of us were gone for good and that Atlanta
      was saved. Naturally they felt mighty happy over it; and resolved to have
      a big celebration&mdash;a ball, a meeting of jubilee, etc. Extra trains
      were run in, with girls and women from the surrounding country, and they
      just had a high old time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the meantime we were going through so many different kinds of tactics
      that it looked as if Sherman was really crazy this time, sure. Finally we
      made a grand left wheel, and then went forward a long way in line of
      battle. It puzzled us a good deal, but we knew that Sherman couldn't get
      us into any scrape that Pap Thomas couldn't get us out of, and so it was
      all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Along on the evening of the 31st our right wing seemed to have run
      against a hornet's nest, and we could hear the musketry and cannon speak
      out real spiteful, but nothing came down our way. We had struck the
      railroad leading south from Atlanta to Macon, and began tearing it up. The
      jollity at Atlanta was stopped right in the middle by the appalling news
      that the Yankees hadn't retreated worth a cent, but had broken out in a
      new and much worse spot than ever. Then there was no end of trouble all
      around, and Hood started part of his army back after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Part of Hardee's and Pat Cleburne's command went into position in front
      of us. We left them alone till Stanley could come up on our left, and
      swing around, so as to cut off their retreat, when we would bag every one
      of them. But Stanley was as slow as he always was, and did not come up
      until it was too late, and the game was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun was just going down on the evening of the 1st of September, when
      we began to see we were in for it, sure. The Fourteenth Corps wheeled into
      position near the railroad, and the sound of musketry and artillery became
      very loud and clear on our front and left. We turned a little and marched
      straight toward the racket, becoming more excited every minute. We saw the
      Carlin's brigade of regulars, who were some distance ahead of us, pile
      knapsacks, form in line, fix bayonets, and dash off with arousing cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Rebel fire beat upon them like a Summer rain-storm, the ground shook
      with the noise, and just as we reached the edge of the cotton field, we
      saw the remnant of the brigade come flying back out of the awful, blasting
      shower of bullets. The whole slope was covered with dead and wounded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," interrupts one of the Fourteenth; "and they made that charge right
      gamely, too, I can tell you. They were good soldiers, and well led. When
      we went over the works, I remember seeing the body of a little Major of
      one of the regiments lying right on the top. If he hadn't been killed he'd
      been inside in a half-a-dozen steps more. There's no mistake about it;
      those regulars will fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we saw this," resumed the narrator, "it set our fellows fairly wild;
      they became just crying mad; I never saw them so before. The order came to
      strip for the charge, and our knapsacks were piled in half a minute. A
      Lieutenant of our company, who was then on the staff of Gen. Baird, our
      division commander, rode slowly down the line and gave us our instructions
      to load our guns, fix bayonets, and hold fire until we were on top of the
      Rebel works. Then Colonel Este sang out clear and steady as a bugle
      signal:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Brigade, forward! Guide center! MARCH!!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we started. Heavens, how they did let into us, as we came up into
      range. They had ten pieces of artillery, and more men behind the
      breastworks than we had in line, and the fire they poured on us was simply
      withering. We walked across the hundreds of dead and dying of the regular
      brigade, and at every step our own men fell down among them. General
      Baud's horse was shot down, and the General thrown far over his head, but
      he jumped up and ran alongside of us. Major Wilson, our regimental
      commander, fell mortally wounded; Lieutenant Kirk was killed, and also
      Captain Stopfard, Adjutant General of the brigade. Lieutenants Cobb and
      Mitchell dropped with wounds that proved fatal in a few days. Captain Ugan
      lost an arm, one-third of the enlisted men fell, but we went straight
      ahead, the grape and the musketry becoming worse every step, until we
      gained the edge of the hill, where we were checked a minute by the brush,
      which the Rebels had fixed up in the shape of abattis. Just then a
      terrible fire from a new direction, our left, swept down the whole length
      of our line. The Colonel of the Seventeenth New York&mdash;as gallant a
      man as ever lived saw the new trouble, took his regiment in on the run,
      and relieved us of this, but he was himself mortally wounded. If our boys
      were half-crazy before, they were frantic now, and as we got out of the
      entanglement of the brush, we raised a fearful yell and ran at the works.
      We climbed the sides, fired right down into the defenders, and then began
      with the bayonet and sword. For a few minutes it was simply awful. On both
      sides men acted like infuriated devils. They dashed each other's brains
      out with clubbed muskets; bayonets were driven into men's bodies up to the
      muzzle of the gun; officers ran their swords through their opponents, and
      revolvers, after being emptied into the faces of the Rebels, were thrown
      with desperate force into the ranks. In our regiment was a stout German
      butcher named Frank Fleck. He became so excited that he threw down his
      sword, and rushed among the Rebels with his bare fists, knocking down a
      swath of them. He yelled to the first Rebel he met:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Py Gott, I've no patience mit you,' and knocked him sprawling. He caught
      hold of the commander of the Rebel Brigade, and snatched him back over the
      works by main strength. Wonderful to say, he escaped unhurt, but the boys
      will probably not soon let him hear the last of,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Py Gott, I've no patience mit you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Tenth Kentucky, by the queerest luck in the world, was matched
      against the Rebel Ninth Kentucky. The commanders of the two regiments were
      brothers-in-law, and the men relatives, friends, acquaintances and
      schoolmates. They hated each other accordingly, and the fight between them
      was more bitter, if possible, than anywhere else on the line. The
      Thirty-Eighth Ohio and Seventy-fourth Indiana put in some work that was
      just magnificent. We hadn't time to look at it then, but the dead and
      wounded piled up after the fight told the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We gradually forced our way over the works, but the Rebels were game to
      the last, and we had to make them surrender almost one at a time. The
      artillerymen tried to fire on us when we were so close we could lay our
      hands on the guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finally nearly all in the works surrendered, and were disarmed and
      marched back. Just then an aid came dashing up with the information that
      we must turn the works, and get ready to receive Hardee, who was advancing
      to retake the position. We snatched up some shovels lying near, and began
      work. We had no time to remove the dead and dying Rebels on the works, and
      the dirt we threw covered them up. It proved a false alarm. Hardee had as
      much as he could do to save his own hide, and the affair ended about dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we came to count up what we had gained, we found that we had
      actually taken more prisoners from behind breastworks than there were in
      our brigade when we started the charge. We had made the only really
      successful bayonet charge of the campaign. Every other time since we left
      Chattanooga the party standing on the defensive had been successful. Here
      we had taken strong double lines, with ten guns, seven battle flags, and
      over two thousand prisoners. We had lost terribly&mdash;not less than
      one-third of the brigade, and many of our best men. Our regiment went into
      the battle with fifteen officers; nine of these were killed or wounded,
      and seven of the nine lost either their limbs or lives. The Thirty-Eighth
      Ohio, and the other regiments of the brigade lost equally heavy. We
      thought Chickamauga awful, but Jonesboro discounted it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," said another of the Fourteenth, "I heard our Surgeon
      telling about how that Colonel Grower, of the Seventeenth New York, who
      came in so splendidly on our left, died? They say he was a Wall Street
      broker, before the war. He was hit shortly after he led his regiment in,
      and after the fight, was carried back to the hospital. While our Surgeon
      was going the rounds Colonel Grower called him, and said quietly, 'When
      you get through with the men, come and see me, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Doctor would have attended to him then, but Grower wouldn't let him.
      After he got through he went back to Grower, examined his wound, and told
      him that he could only live a few hours. Grower received the news
      tranquilly, had the Doctor write a letter to his wife, and gave him his
      things to send her, and then grasping the Doctor's hand, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor, I've just one more favor to ask; will you grant it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Doctor said, 'Certainly; what is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say I can't live but a few hours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; that is true.' "And that I will likely be in great pain!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to say so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, do give me morphia enough to put me to sleep, so that I will
      wake up only in another world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Doctor did so; Colonel Grower thanked him; wrung his hand, bade him
      good-by, and went to sleep to wake no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?" said another of the
      Fourteenth. There was Fisher Pray, Orderly Sergeant of Company I. He came
      from Waterville, O., where his folks are now living. The day before we
      started out he had a presentiment that we were going into a fight, and
      that he would be killed. He couldn't shake it off. He told the Lieutenant,
      and some of the boys about it, and they tried to ridicule him out of it,
      but it was no good. When the sharp firing broke out in front some of the
      boys said, 'Fisher, I do believe you are right,' and he nodded his head
      mournfully. When we were piling knapsacks for the charge, the Lieutenant,
      who was a great friend of Fisher's, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fisher, you stay here and guard the knapsacks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fisher's face blazed in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir,' said he; I never shirked a fight yet, and I won't begin now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he went into the fight, and was killed, as he knew he would be. Now,
      that's what I call nerve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same thing was true of Sergeant Arthur Tarbox, of Company A," said
      the narrator; "he had a presentiment, too; he knew he was going to be
      killed, if he went in, and he was offered an honorable chance to stay out,
      but he would not take it, and went in and was killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we staid there the next day, buried our dead, took care of our
      wounded, and gathered up the plunder we had taken from the Johnnies. The
      rest of the army went off, 'hot blocks,' after Hardee and the rest of
      Hood's army, which it was hoped would be caught outside of entrenchments.
      But Hood had too much the start, and got into the works at Lovejoy, ahead
      of our fellows. The night before we heard several very loud explosions up
      to the north. We guessed what that meant, and so did the Twentieth Corps,
      who were lying back at the Chattahoochee, and the next morning the General
      commanding&mdash;Slocum&mdash;sent out a reconnaissance. It was met by the
      Mayor of Atlanta, who said that the Rebels had blown up their stores and
      retreated. The Twentieth Corps then came in and took 'possession of the
      City, and the next day&mdash;the 3d&mdash;Sherman came in, and issued an
      order declaring the campaign at an end, and that we would rest awhile and
      refit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We laid around Atlanta a good while, and things quieted down so that it
      seemed almost like peace, after the four months of continual fighting we
      had gone through. We had been under a strain so long that now we boys went
      in the other direction, and became too careless, and that's how we got
      picked up. We went out about five miles one night after a lot of nice
      smoked hams that a nigger told us were stored in an old cotton press, and
      which we knew would be enough sight better eating for Company C, than the
      commissary pork we had lived on so long. We found the cotton press, and
      the hams, just as the nigger told us, and we hitched up a team to take
      them into camp. As we hadn't seen any Johnny signs anywhere, we set our
      guns down to help load the meat, and just as we all came stringing out to
      the wagon with as much meat as we could carry, a company of Ferguson's
      Cavalry popped out of the woods about one hundred yards in front of us and
      were on top of us before we could say I scat. You see they'd heard of the
      meat, too." <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp445" id="linkp445"></a>

    <p>
      A FAIR SACRIFICE&mdash;THE STORY OF ONE BOY WHO WILLINGLY GAVE HIS YOUNG
      LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley Barbour was one of the truest-hearted and best-liked of my
      school-boy chums and friends. For several terms we sat together on the
      same uncompromisingly uncomfortable bench, worried over the same
      boy-maddening problems in "Ray's Arithmetic-Part III.," learned the same
      jargon of meaningless rules from "Greene's Grammar," pondered over
      "Mitchell's Geography and Atlas," and tried in vain to understand why
      Providence made the surface of one State obtrusively pink and another
      ultramarine blue; trod slowly and painfully over the rugged road "Bullion"
      points out for beginners in Latin, and began to believe we should hate
      ourselves and everybody else, if we were gotten up after the manner shown
      by "Cutter's Physiology." We were caught together in the same long series
      of school-boy scrapes&mdash;and were usually ferruled together by the same
      strong-armed teacher. We shared nearly everything &mdash;our fun and work;
      enjoyment and annoyance&mdash;all were generally meted out to us together.
      We read from the same books the story of the wonderful world we were going
      to see in that bright future "when we were men;" we spent our Saturdays
      and vacations in the miniature explorations of the rocky hills and caves,
      and dark cedar woods around our homes, to gather ocular helps to a better
      comprehension of that magical land which we were convinced began just
      beyond our horizon, and had in it, visible to the eye of him who traveled
      through its enchanted breadth, all that "Gulliver's Fables," the "Arabian
      Nights," and a hundred books of travel and adventure told of.
    </p>
    <p>
      We imagined that the only dull and commonplace spot on earth was that
      where we lived. Everywhere else life was a grand spectacular drama, full
      of thrilling effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brave and handsome young men were rescuing distressed damsels, beautiful
      as they were wealthy; bloody pirates and swarthy murderers were being
      foiled by quaint spoken backwoodsmen, who carried unerring rifles; gallant
      but blundering Irishmen, speaking the most delightful brogue, and making
      the funniest mistakes, were daily thwarting cool and determined villains;
      bold tars were encountering fearful sea perils; lionhearted adventurers
      were cowing and quelling whole tribes of barbarians; magicians were
      casting spells, misers hoarding gold, scientists making astonishing
      discoveries, poor and unknown boys achieving wealth and fame at a single
      bound, hidden mysteries coming to light, and so the world was going on,
      making reams of history with each diurnal revolution, and furnishing
      boundless material for the most delightful books.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of thirteen a perusal of the lives of Benjamin Franklin and
      Horace Greeley precipitated my determination to no longer hesitate in
      launching my small bark upon the great ocean. I ran away from home in a
      truly romantic way, and placed my foot on what I expected to be the first
      round of the ladder of fame, by becoming "devil boy" in a printing office
      in a distant large City. Charley's attachment to his mother and his home
      was too strong to permit him to take this step, and we parted in sorrow,
      mitigated on my side by roseate dreams of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six years passed. One hot August morning I met an old acquaintance at the
      Creek, in Andersonville. He told me to come there the next morning, after
      roll-call, and he would take me to see some person who was very anxious to
      meet me. I was prompt at the rendezvous, and was soon joined by the other
      party. He threaded his way slowly for over half an hour through the
      closely-jumbled mass of tents and burrows, and at length stopped in front
      of a blanket-tent in the northwestern corner. The occupant rose and took
      my hand. For an instant I was puzzled; then the clear, blue eyes, and
      well-remembered smile recalled to me my old-time comrade, Charley Barbour.
      His story was soon told. He was a Sergeant in a Western Virginia cavalry
      regiment&mdash;the Fourth, I think. At the time Hunter was making his
      retreat from the Valley of Virginia, it was decided to mislead the enemy
      by sending out a courier with false dispatches to be captured. There was a
      call for a volunteer for this service. Charley was the first to offer,
      with that spirit of generous self-sacrifice that was one of his
      pleasantest traits when a boy. He knew what he had to expect. Capture
      meant imprisonment at Andersonville; our men had now a pretty clear
      understanding of what this was. Charley took the dispatches and rode into
      the enemy's lines. He was taken, and the false information produced the
      desired effect. On his way to Andersonville he was stripped of all his
      clothing but his shirt and pantaloons, and turned into the Stockade in
      this condition. When I saw him he had been in a week or more. He told his
      story quietly&mdash;almost diffidently&mdash;not seeming aware that he had
      done more than his simple duty. I left him with the promise and
      expectation of returning the next day, but when I attempted to find him
      again, I was lost in the maze of tents and burrows. I had forgotten to ask
      the number of his detachment, and after spending several days in hunting
      for him, I was forced to give the search up. He knew as little of my
      whereabouts, and though we were all the time within seventeen hundred feet
      of each other, neither we nor our common acquaintance could ever manage to
      meet again. This will give the reader an idea of the throng compressed
      within the narrow limits of the Stockade. After leaving Andersonville,
      however, I met this man once more, and learned from him that Charley had
      sickened and died within a month after his entrance to prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended his day-dream of a career in the busy world. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      WE LEAVE SAVANNAH&mdash;MORE HOPES OF EXCHANGE&mdash;SCENES AT DEPARTURE
      &mdash;"FLANKERS"&mdash;ON THE BACK TRACK TOWARD ANDERSONVILLE&mdash;ALARM
      THEREAT &mdash;AT THE PARTING OF TWO WAYS&mdash;WE FINALLY BRING UP AT
      CAMP LAWTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 11th of October there came an order for one thousand
      prisoners to fall in and march out, for transfer to some other point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Andrews and I "flanked" into this crowd. That was our usual way
      of doing. Holding that the chances were strongly in favor of every
      movement of prisoners being to our lines, we never failed to be numbered
      in the first squad of prisoners that were sent out. The seductive mirage
      of "exchange" was always luring us on. It must come some time, certainly,
      and it would be most likely to come to those who were most earnestly
      searching for it. At all events, we should leave no means untried to avail
      ourselves of whatever seeming chances there might be. There could be no
      other motive for this move, we argued, than exchange. The Confederacy was
      not likely to be at the trouble and expense of hauling us about the
      country without some good reason&mdash;something better than a wish to
      make us acquainted with Southern scenery and topography. It would hardly
      take us away from Savannah so soon after bringing us there for any other
      purpose than delivery to our people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebels encouraged this belief with direct assertions of its truth.
      They framed a plausible lie about there having arisen some difficulty
      concerning the admission of our vessels past the harbor defenses of
      Savannah, which made it necessary to take us elsewhere&mdash;probably to
      Charleston&mdash;for delivery to our men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wishes are always the most powerful allies of belief. There is little
      difficulty in convincing a man of that of which he wants to be convinced.
      We forgot the lie told us when we were taken from Andersonville, and
      believed the one which was told us now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrews and I hastily snatched our worldly possessions&mdash;our overcoat,
      blanket, can, spoon, chessboard and men, yelled to some of our neighbors
      that they could have our hitherto much-treasured house, and running down
      to the gate, forced ourselves well up to the front of the crowd that was
      being assembled to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual scenes accompanying the departure of first squads were being
      acted tumultuously. Every one in the camp wanted to be one of the
      supposed-to-be-favored few, and if not selected at first, tried to "flank
      in"&mdash;that is, slip into the place of some one else who had had better
      luck. This one naturally resisted displacement, 'vi et armis,' and the
      fights would become so general as to cause a resemblance to the famed Fair
      of Donnybrook. The cry would go up:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out for flankers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines of the selected would dress up compactly, and outsiders trying
      to force themselves in would get mercilessly pounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      We finally got out of the pen, and into the cars, which soon rolled away
      to the westward. We were packed in too densely to be able to lie down. We
      could hardly sit down. Andrews and I took up our position in one corner,
      piled our little treasures under us, and trying to lean against each other
      in such a way as to afford mutual support and rest, dozed fitfully through
      a long, weary night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning came we found ourselves running northwest through a poor,
      pine-barren country that strongly resembled that we had traversed in
      coming to Savannah. The more we looked at it the more familiar it became,
      and soon there was no doubt we were going back to Andersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      By noon we had reached Millen&mdash;eighty miles from Savannah, and
      fifty-three from Augusta. It was the junction of the road leading to Macon
      and that running to Augusta. We halted a little while at the "Y," and to
      us the minutes were full of anxiety. If we turned off to the left we were
      going back to Andersonville. If we took the right hand road we were on the
      way to Charleston or Richmond, with the chances in favor of exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length we started, and, to our joy, our engine took the right hand
      track. We stopped again, after a run of five miles, in the midst of one of
      the open, scattering forests of long leaved pine that I have before
      described. We were ordered out of the cars, and marching a few rods, came
      in sight of another of those hateful Stockades, which seemed to be as
      natural products of the Sterile sand of that dreary land as its desolate
      woods and its breed of boy murderers and gray-headed assassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again our hearts sank, and death seemed more welcome than incarceration in
      those gloomy wooden walls. We marched despondently up to the gates of the
      Prison, and halted while a party of Rebel clerks made a list of our names,
      rank, companies, and regiments. As they were Rebels it was slow work.
      Reading and writing never came by nature, as Dogberry would say, to any
      man fighting for Secession. As a rule, he took to them as reluctantly as
      if, he thought them cunning inventions of the Northern Abolitionist to
      perplex and demoralize him. What a half-dozen boys taken out of our own
      ranks would have done with ease in an hour or so, these Rebels worried
      over all of the afternoon, and then their register of us was so imperfect,
      badly written and misspelled, that the Yankee clerks afterwards detailed
      for the purpose, never could succeed in reducing it to intelligibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      We learned that the place at which we had arrived was Camp Lawton, but we
      almost always spoke of it as "Millen," the same as Camp Sumter is
      universally known as Andersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after dark we were turned inside the Stockade. Being the first
      that had entered, there was quite a quantity of wood&mdash;the offal from
      the timber used in constructing the Stockade&mdash;lying on the ground.
      The night was chilly one we soon had a number of fires blazing. Green
      pitch pine, when burned, gives off a peculiar, pungent odor, which is
      never forgotten by one who has once smelled it. I first became acquainted
      with it on entering Andersonville, and to this day it is the most powerful
      remembrance I can have of the opening of that dreadful Iliad of woes. On
      my journey to Washington of late years the locomotives are invariably fed
      with pitch pine as we near the Capital, and as the well-remembered smell
      reaches me, I grow sick at heart with the flood of saddening recollections
      indissolubly associated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As our fires blazed up the clinging, penetrating fumes diffused themselves
      everywhere. The night was as cool as the one when we arrived at
      Andersonville, the earth, meagerly sodded with sparse, hard, wiry grass,
      was the same; the same piney breezes blew in from the surrounding trees,
      the same dismal owls hooted at us; the same mournful whip-poor-will
      lamented, God knows what, in the gathering twilight. What we both felt in
      the gloomy recesses of downcast hearts Andrews expressed as he turned to
      me with:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, Mc, this looks like Andersonville all over again."
    </p>
    <p>
      A cupful of corn meal was issued to each of us. I hunted up some water.
      Andrews made a stiff dough, and spread it about half an inch thick on the
      back of our chessboard. He propped this up before the fire, and when the
      surface was neatly browned over, slipped it off the board and turned it
      over to brown the other side similarly. This done, we divided it carefully
      between us, swallowed it in silence, spread our old overcoat on the
      ground, tucked chess-board, can, and spoon under far enough to be out of
      the reach of thieves, adjusted the thin blanket so as to get the most
      possible warmth out of it, crawled in close together, and went to sleep.
      This, thank Heaven, we could do; we could still sleep, and Nature had some
      opportunity to repair the waste of the day. We slept, and forgot where we
      were. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp454" id="linkp454"></a>

    </h2>
    <p>
      OUR NEW QUARTERS AT CAMP LAWTON&mdash;BUILDING A HUT&mdash;AN EXCEPTIONAL
      COMMANDANT&mdash;HE IS a GOOD MAN, BUT WILL TAKE BRIBES&mdash;RATIONS.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning we took a survey of our new quarters, and found that we
      were in a Stockade resembling very much in construction and dimensions
      that at Andersonville. The principal difference was that the upright logs
      were in their rough state, whereas they were hewed at Andersonville, and
      the brook running through the camp was not bordered by a swamp, but had
      clean, firm banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our next move was to make the best of the situation. We were divided into
      hundreds, each commanded by a Sergeant. Ten hundreds constituted a
      division, the head of which was also a Sergeant. I was elected by my
      comrades to the Sergeantcy of the Second Hundred of the First Division. As
      soon as we were assigned to our ground, we began constructing shelter. For
      the first and only time in my prison experience, we found a full supply of
      material for this purpose, and the use we made of it showed how infinitely
      better we would have fared if in each prison the Rebels had done even so
      slight a thing as to bring in a few logs from the surrounding woods and
      distribute them to us. A hundred or so of these would probably have saved
      thousands of lives at Andersonville and Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large tree lay on the ground assigned to our hundred. Andrews and I took
      possession of one side of the ten feet nearest the butt. Other boys
      occupied the rest in a similar manner. One of our boys had succeeded in
      smuggling an ax in with him, and we kept it in constant use day and night,
      each group borrowing it for an hour or so at a time. It was as dull as a
      hoe, and we were very weak, so that it was slow work "niggering off"&mdash;(as
      the boys termed it) a cut of the log. It seemed as if beavers could have
      gnawed it off easier and more quickly. We only cut an inch or so at a
      time, and then passed the ax to the next users. Making little wedges with
      a dull knife, we drove them into the log with clubs, and split off long,
      thin strips, like the weatherboards of a house, and by the time we had
      split off our share of the log in this slow and laborious way, we had a
      fine lot of these strips. We were lucky enough to find four forked sticks,
      of which we made the corners of our dwelling, and roofed it carefully with
      our strips, held in place by sods torn up from the edge of the creek bank.
      The sides and ends were enclosed; we gathered enough pine tops to cover
      the ground to a depth of several inches; we banked up the outside, and
      ditched around it, and then had the most comfortable abode we had during
      our prison career. It was truly a house builded with our own hands, for we
      had no tools whatever save the occasional use of the aforementioned dull
      axe and equally dull knife. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp457"
      id="linkp457"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img alt="p457.jpg (60K)" src="images/p457.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The rude little hut represented as much actual hard, manual labor as would
      be required to build a comfortable little cottage in the North, but we
      gladly performed it, as we would have done any other work to better our
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while wood was quite plentiful, and we had the luxury daily of warm
      fires, which the increasing coolness of the weather made important
      accessories to our comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other prisoners kept coming in. Those we left behind at Savannah followed
      us, and the prison there was broken up. Quite a number also came in from&mdash;Andersonville,
      so that in a little while we had between six and seven thousand in the
      Stockade. The last comers found all the material for tents and all the
      fuel used up, and consequently did not fare so well as the earlier
      arrivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commandant of the prison&mdash;one Captain Bowes&mdash;was the best of
      his class it was my fortune to meet. Compared with the senseless brutality
      of Wirz, the reckless deviltry of Davis, or the stupid malignance of
      Barrett, at Florence, his administration was mildness and wisdom itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enforced discipline better than any of those named, but has what they
      all lacked&mdash;executive ability&mdash;and he secured results that they
      could not possibly attain, and without anything, like the friction that
      attended their efforts. I do not remember that any one was shot during our
      six weeks' stay at Millen&mdash;a circumstance simply remarkable, since I
      do not recall a single week passed anywhere else without at least one
      murder by the guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      One instance will illustrate the difference of his administration from
      that of other prison commandants. He came upon the grounds of our division
      one morning, accompanied by a pleasant-faced, intelligent-appearing lad of
      about fifteen or sixteen. He said to us:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen: (The only instance during our imprisonment when we received so
      polite a designation.) This is my son, who will hereafter call your roll.
      He will treat you as gentlemen, and I know you will do the same to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      This understanding was observed to the letter on both sides. Young Bowes
      invariably spoke civilly to us, and we obeyed his orders with a prompt
      cheerfulness that left him nothing to complain of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only charge I have to make against Bowes is made more in detail in
      another chapter, and that is, that he took money from well prisoners for
      giving them the first chance to go through on the Sick Exchange. How
      culpable this was I must leave each reader to decide for himself. I
      thought it very wrong at the time, but possibly my views might have been
      colored highly by my not having any money wherewith to procure my own
      inclusion in the happy lot of the exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of one thing I am certain: that his acceptance of money to bias his
      official action was not singular on his part. I am convinced that every
      commandant we had over us&mdash;except Wirz&mdash;was habitually in the
      receipt of bribes from prisoners. I never heard that any one succeeded in
      bribing Wirz, and this is the sole good thing I can say of that fellow.
      Against this it may be said, however, that he plundered the boys so
      effectually on entering the prison as to leave them little of the
      wherewithal to bribe anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis was probably the most unscrupulous bribe-taker of the lot. He
      actually received money for permitting prisoners to escape to our lines,
      and got down to as low a figure as one hundred dollars for this sort of
      service. I never heard that any of the other commandants went this far.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rations issued to us were somewhat better than those of Andersonville,
      as the meal was finer and better, though it was absurdedly insufficient in
      quantity, and we received no salt. On several occasions fresh beef was
      dealt out to us, and each time the excitement created among those who had
      not tasted fresh meat for weeks and months was wonderful. On the first
      occasion the meat was simply the heads of the cattle killed for the use of
      the guards. Several wagon loads of these were brought in and distributed.
      We broke them up so that every man got a piece of the bone, which was
      boiled and reboiled, as long as a single bubble of grease would rise to
      the surface of the water; every vestige of meat was gnawed and scraped
      from the surface and then the bone was charred until it crumbled, when it
      was eaten. No one who has not experienced it can imagine the inordinate
      hunger for animal food of those who had eaten little else than corn bread
      for so long. Our exhausted bodies were perishing for lack of proper
      sustenance. Nature indicated fresh beef as the best medium to repair the
      great damage already done, and our longing for it became beyond
      description. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp459" id="linkp459"></a>

      THE RAIDERS REAPPEAR ON THE SCENE&mdash;THE ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THOSE
      WHO WERE CONCERNED IN THE EXECUTION&mdash;A COUPLE OF LIVELY FIGHTS, IN
      WHICH THE RAIDERS ARE DEFEATED&mdash;HOLDING AN ELECTION.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our old antagonists&mdash;the Raiders&mdash;were present in strong force
      in Millen. Like ourselves, they had imagined the departure from
      Andersonville was for exchange, and their relations to the Rebels were
      such that they were all given a chance to go with the first squads. A
      number had been allowed to go with the sailors on the Special Naval
      Exchange from Savannah, in the place of sailors and marines who had died.
      On the way to Charleston a fight had taken place between them and the real
      sailors, during which one of their number&mdash;a curly-headed Irishman
      named Dailey, who was in such high favor with the Rebels that he was given
      the place of driving the ration wagon that came in the North Side at
      Andersonville &mdash;was killed, and thrown under the wheels of the moving
      train, which passed over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After things began to settle into shape at Millen, they seemed to believe
      that they were in such ascendancy as to numbers and organization that they
      could put into execution their schemes of vengeance against those of us
      who had been active participants in the execution of their confederates at
      Andersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some little preliminaries they settled upon Corporal "Wat" Payne, of
      my company, as their first victim. The reader will remember Payne as one
      of the two Corporals who pulled the trigger to the scaffold at the time of
      the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Payne was a very good man physically, and was yet in fair condition. The
      Raiders came up one day with their best man&mdash;Pete Donnelly&mdash;and
      provoked a fight, intending, in the course of it, to kill Payne. We, who
      knew Payee, felt reasonably confident of his ability to handle even so
      redoubtable a pugilist as Donnelly, and we gathered together a little
      squad of our friends to see fair play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight began after the usual amount of bad talk on both sides, and we
      were pleased to see our man slowly get the better of the New York
      plug-ugly. After several sharp rounds they closed, and still Payne was
      ahead, but in an evil moment he spied a pine knot at his feet, which he
      thought he could reach, and end the fight by cracking Donnelly's head with
      it. Donnelly took instant advantage of the movement to get it, threw Payne
      heavily, and fell upon him. His crowd rushed in to finish our man by
      clubbing him over the head. We sailed in to prevent this, and after a
      rattling exchange of blows all around, succeeded in getting Payne away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue of the fight seemed rather against us, however, and the Raiders
      were much emboldened. Payne kept close to his crowd after that, and as we
      had shown such an entire willingness to stand by him, the Raiders &mdash;with
      their accustomed prudence when real fighting was involved&mdash;did not
      attempt to molest him farther, though they talked very savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after this Sergeant Goody and Corporal Ned Carrigan, both of
      our battalion, came in. I must ask the reader to again recall the fact
      that Sergeant Goody was one of the six hangmen who put the meal-sacks over
      the heads, and the ropes around the necks of the condemned. Corporal
      Carrigan was the gigantic prize fighter, who was universally acknowledged
      to be the best man physically among the whole thirty-four thousand in
      Andersonville. The Raiders knew that Goody had come in before we of his
      own battalion did. They resolved to kill him then and there, and in broad
      daylight. He had secured in some way a shelter tent, and was inside of it
      fixing it up. The Raider crowd, headed by Pete Donnelly, and Dick Allen,
      went up to his tent and one of them called to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergeant, come out; I want to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Goody, supposing it was one of us, came crawling out on his hands and
      knees. As he did so their heavy clubs crashed down upon his head. He was
      neither killed nor stunned, as they had reason to expect. He succeeded in
      rising to his feet, and breaking through the crowd of assassins. He dashed
      down the side of the hill, hotly pursued by them. Coming to the Creek, he
      leaped it in his excitement, but his pursuers could not, and were checked.
      One of our battalion boys, who saw and comprehended the whole affair, ran
      over to us, shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn out! turn out, for God's sake! the Raiders are killing Goody!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We snatched up our clubs and started after the Raiders, but before we
      could reach them, Ned Carrigan, who also comprehended what the trouble
      was, had run to the side of Goody, armed with a terrible looking club. The
      sight of Ned, and the demonstration that he was thoroughly aroused, was
      enough for the Raider crew, and they abandoned the field hastily. We did
      not feel ourselves strong enough to follow them on to their own dung hill,
      and try conclusions with them, but we determined to report the matter to
      the Rebel Commandant, from whom we had reason to believe we could expect
      assistance. We were right. He sent in a squad of guards, arrested Dick
      Allen, Pete Donnelly, and several other ringleaders, took them out and put
      them in the stocks in such a manner that they were compelled to lie upon
      their stomachs. A shallow tin vessel containing water was placed under
      their faces to furnish them drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      They staid there a day and night, and when released, joined the Rebel
      Army, entering the artillery company that manned the guns in the fort
      covering the prison. I used to imagine with what zeal they would send us
      over; a round of shell or grape if they could get anything like an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gave us good riddance&mdash;of our dangerous enemies, and we had
      little further trouble with any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depression in the temperature made me very sensible of the
      deficiencies in my wardrobe. Unshod feet, a shirt like a fishing net, and
      pantaloons as well ventilated as a paling fence might do very well for the
      broiling sun at Andersonville and Savannah, but now, with the thermometer
      nightly dipping a little nearer the frost line, it became unpleasantly
      evident that as garments their office was purely perfunctory; one might
      say ornamental simply, if he wanted to be very sarcastic. They were worn
      solely to afford convenient quarters for multitudes of lice, and in
      deference to the prejudice which has existed since the Fall of Man against
      our mingling with our fellow creatures in the attire provided us by
      Nature. Had I read Darwin then I should have expected that my long
      exposure to the weather would start a fine suit of fur, in the effort of
      Nature to adapt me to my environment. But no more indications of this
      appeared than if I had been a hairless dog of Mexico, suddenly
      transplanted to more northern latitudes. Providence did not seem to be in
      the tempering-the-wind-to-the-shorn-lamb business, as far as I was
      concerned. I still retained an almost unconquerable prejudice against
      stripping the dead to secure clothes, and so unless exchange or death came
      speedily, I was in a bad fix. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="linkp463"

      One morning about day break, Andrews, who had started to go to another
      part of the camp, came slipping back in a state of gleeful excitement. At
      first I thought he either had found a tunnel or had heard some good news
      about exchange. It was neither. He opened his jacket and handed me an
      infantry man's blouse, which he had found in the main street, where it had
      dropped out of some fellow's bundle. We did not make any extra exertion to
      find the owner. Andrews was in sore need of clothes himself, but my
      necessities were so much greater that the generous fellow thought of my
      wants first. We examined the garment with as much interest as ever a belle
      bestowed on a new dress from Worth's. It was in fair preservation, but the
      owner had cut the buttons off to trade to the guard, doubtless for a few
      sticks of wood, or a spoonful of salt. We supplied the place of these with
      little wooden pins, and I donned the garment as a shirt and coat and vest,
      too, for that matter. The best suit I ever put on never gave me a
      hundredth part the satisfaction that this did. Shortly after, I managed to
      subdue my aversion so far as to take a good shoe which a one-legged dead
      man had no farther use for, and a little later a comrade gave me for the
      other foot a boot bottom from which he had cut the top to make a bucket.

      ........................... <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of the Presidential election of 1864 approached. The Rebels were
      naturally very much interested in the result, as they believed that the
      election of McClellan meant compromise and cessation of hostilities, while
      the re-election of Lincoln meant prosecution of the War to the bitter end.
      The toadying Raiders, who were perpetually hanging around the gate to get
      a chance to insinuate themselves into the favor of the Rebel officers,
      persuaded them that we were all so bitterly hostile to our Government for
      not exchanging us that if we were allowed to vote we would cast an
      overwhelming majority in favor of McClellan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebels thought that this might perhaps be used to advantage as
      political capital for their friends in the North. They gave orders that we
      might, if we chose, hold an election on the same day of the Presidential
      election. They sent in some ballot boxes, and we elected Judges of the
      Election.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon of that day Captain Bowes, and a crowd of tightbooted,
      broad-hatted Rebel officers, strutted in with the peculiar
      "Ef-yer-don't-b'lieve&mdash;I'm-a-butcher-jest-smell-o'-mebutes" swagger
      characteristic of the class. They had come in to see us all voting for
      McClellan. Instead, they found the polls surrounded with ticket pedlers
      shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walk right up here now, and get your Unconditional-Union-Abraham-Lincoln
      -tickets!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's your straight-haired prosecution-of-the-war ticket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vote the Lincoln ticket; vote to whip the Rebels, and make peace with
      them when they've laid down their arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't vote a McClellan ticket and gratify Rebels, everywhere," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rebel officers did not find the scene what their fancy painted it, and
      turning around they strutted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the votes came to be counted out there were over seven thousand for
      Lincoln, and not half that many hundred for McClellan. The latter got very
      few votes outside the Raider crowd. The same day a similar election was
      held in Florence, with like result. Of course this did not indicate that
      there was any such a preponderance of Republicans among us. It meant
      simply that the Democratic boys, little as they might have liked Lincoln,
      would have voted for him a hundred times rather than do anything to please
      the Rebels.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never heard that the Rebels sent the result North. <br /> <br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
